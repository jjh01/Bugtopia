# Radar "Game" map display — final implementation

Status: **shipped**. Lets the radar render its selected resources natively on the in-game
**minimap + in-world tracking** (and optionally the **big map**), instead of (or alongside) the
screen-space ESP overlay. Plan/history: [plans/2026-06-22-radar-game-mapspots.md](plans/2026-06-22-radar-game-mapspots.md).
Implementation: `buddy/HeartopiaComplete.MapSpots.cs` (+ radar UI/config in `HeartopiaComplete.Radar.cs`,
`HeartopiaComplete.ConfigTypes.cs`, `HeartopiaComplete.cs`).

## User-facing

Radar panel → Game mode:
- **ESP Overlay / Game Map** selector (`radarDisplayMode`, 0/1).
- **Map Markers (nearest): N** slider (`radarGameTrackLimit`, 1–30) — caps how many nearest resources are tracked.
- **Show on big map** toggle (`radarBigMapSpots`, **default OFF**). Off = minimap + in-world only.

Features → Main (both **default OFF**, both opt-in detour groups — see below). They live there rather than on
the radar page because neither is radar-mode-specific: the avatar group also upgrades the VANILLA player pins,
and the name group drives the over-head nameplate and chat. Radar → Settings' **Reset Defaults** deliberately
does **not** clear them (a reset button only clears its own page); they still ride in `RadarConfigData` for
persistence and save through `QueueRadarSettingsSave`.
- **Player Avatars (all)** toggle (`radarPlayerAvatarsAll`) — real avatar photos on map player markers and the
  in-world pointer for every player, not only friends.
- **Player Names (all)** toggle (`radarPlayerNamesAll`) — real names for non-friends instead of the Title the
  game shows strangers (over-head nameplate, map spot label, chat).

Until 2026-07-30 these were ONE segmented row on Radar → Settings (`radarPlayerAvatarsAll`) that drove both
detour groups. Pre-split config files have no `radarPlayerNamesAll` key; it is a tri-state `int` (`-1` =
absent) so those files inherit the old flag's value on load instead of silently losing names. Every later save
writes an explicit 0/1.

Cooldown/depleted resources are hidden. Per-resource icons match the game's native icons. Players show the
native player pin — or their real avatar photo (friends always, everyone with the avatar toggle).
Birds/Fish/Insects show their category icons.

## How the map system works (verified in ilspy-dumps)

The in-game map is a **data-driven registry**, not GameObjects.

- **Minimap** (`CommonMapBar` → `MiniMapSystem.GetMiniMapSpots`) renders **every tracking item directly**
  via `trackingItem.GetAtlasSpriteId()`. It does NOT render `Collectable` map-spots (only Field/Homeland
  are pulled in besides tracks). → tracking is the channel for the minimap + in-world pointers.
- **Big map** (`MapPanel` → `MapSystem.GetVisibleSpot`) renders **`MapSpotData` spots only**, never raw
  tracks. A spot's icon = `MapSpot.GetAtlasSpriteID()`: if a track matches the spot it borrows the track's
  icon (and the spot is flagged `IsTracked` → the widget shows a rectangle frame, `MapSpotWidget.tracked_go`);
  otherwise it uses the category sprite `ui_dynamic_collectable_{usageId}`.

### Tracking injection (minimap + in-world)
`TrackData`/`StartTrack`/`StopTrack` (`XDTDataAndProtocol.ProtocolService.Track`, image XDTDataAndProtocol)
are **pure value structs**. Add a local track by dispatching `XDTGame.Core.EventCenter.DispatchEvent<StartTrack>(in evt)`
(generic — inflate via `mono_metadata_get_generic_inst` + `mono_class_inflate_generic_method`; build the
struct in a raw buffer using `mono_field_get_offset` − 2*IntPtr). `TrackingSystem.AddTracking` adds it
locally (no server). Enums are **byte**: `TrackType` (`Player`=1, `Bird`=5, `Fish`=6, `Insect`=7,
`MapResource`=8, `NavigationPoint`=11, `Furniture`=14), `TrackReason.Local`=1. Each track also spawns an
on-screen HUD pointer → **limit the count** (`radarGameTrackLimit`).

⚠️ **Since the 2026-09-24 game update `TrackData.PositionState` must be set to `Resolved` (1).** The field
(`TrackPositionState : byte { Unresolved, Resolved, Cached }`, raw offset 12, in what used to be padding
before `Token`) is new, and **`Unresolved` = 0 is filtered out** by `MiniMapSystem.GetMiniMapSpots`
(`MiniMapSystem.cs:88`), `MapSpot` (`:502`) and the map track HUD. A zero-filled buffer therefore added
every track successfully (`addOk` counts looked healthy) while nothing appeared on the map or minimap.
`DispatchStartTrack` resolves the offset optionally (absent on older builds) and writes `Resolved`; the
game itself does the same for local markers (`PhotoStatusPanel.cs:939`). The other field offsets did not
move.

### Big-map spot injection
`MapSpotProtocolManager.AddSpot(SpotEnum category, int useId, Vector3 pos, SpotReason reason, GameSceneId)`
/ `RemoveSpot(... 4 args)` (static, value args; image XDTDataAndProtocol, ns ...ProtocolService.MapSpot).
Invoke via AuraMono (`Vector3` by pointer; enums as ints). Enum ints: `SpotEnum.Collectable`=5,
`SpotReason.Auto`=0, `GameSceneId.StarTown`=1. `Collectable` spots pass LOD (`CheckCanShowInLOD` → true);
`Navigation` is hidden when `TableData.GetMapElement(usageId)` is null.

## Icon resolution (the hard part)

Icons live in two atlases:
- **NormalItem** (`ui_item_normal_{prefab}`, ~6205 sprites incl. `p_gather_*` mushrooms, `p_material_*`,
  `p_fruit_*`). Used by `TrackType.Furniture` → `RewardUtility.GetIconName(StaticId)`.
- **Collectable** packed `SpriteAtlas` "collectable_13" (**35 sprites**, keyed by ITEM id). Used by
  `TrackType.MapResource` AND big-map `Collectable` spots → `ui_dynamic_collectable_{id}`. The 35 ids
  (ground truth = the shipped `672355733d89_collectable_13.ab`, dumped offline with `heartopia_ab.py`;
  it is the ONLY atlas whose name matches "collectable" in `icon_index.tsv`, so the runtime dump is
  complete, not a first-of-many):
  - **40xxx** materials/fruits (17): 40001 Branch, 40002 Timber, 40003 Quality Timber, 40004 Rare Timber,
    40006 Roaming Oak Timber, 40021 Stone, 40022 Ore, 40026 Flawless Fluorite, 40033 Bamboo, 40101 Apple,
    40201 Mandarin, 40301 Coconut, 40501 Blueberry, 40502 Raspberry, 40601 Glasswort, 40602 Sea Grape,
    40603 Wakame.
  - **48xxx** mushrooms (6): 48001 Oyster Mushroom, 48002 Shiitake, 48003 Button Mushroom, 48004 Penny Bun,
    48005 Black Truffle, 48006 Matsutake.
  - **49xxx** "Bizarre" mushroom variants (12): 49001-49012.
  Notably **absent**: Starfall Shard 40034/40035/40036 (the meteor drop) — see the big-map section.
  (The `.ab` file list only shows 4 string-named fruit sprites; the numeric ones are PACKED inside the
  atlas — enumerate at runtime via `Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll<SpriteAtlas>()` + `SpriteAtlas.GetSprites`,
  names suffixed `(Clone)`. The atlas only loads once a collectable icon is actually rendered.)

### Resolving a resource → icon id
Per matched resource (matched to a live `CollectableObjectComponent` within 3 m, XZ). **"Bubble" is excluded**
from this matching: bubbles are NavigationPoint tracks but not collectables — a bubble drifting within 3 m (XZ,
height ignored) of a random bush/tree stole its item icon and, via the `mapTrackLabelIcon["Bubble"]` per-label
cache (never cleared), poisoned EVERY bubble marker with that random icon. Bubbles stay on the plain flag.
1. **produce drop-item id** — `CollectableObjectComponent.itemTypeID` (produceId) →
   `TableData.GetMapResourceProduce(produceId)` (sig `(int,bool needException=false)` — **2 params**) →
   `hitProduce` is `string[][]` of **dropGroup KEYS** (e.g. "TREE2031", "BUSH101"), NOT item ids. Resolve a
   key → item via `TableData.get_TableRandomDropsAndLowerUpperLimitsByDropGroup()` →
   `Dictionary<string,(int,int,List<TableRandomDrop>,List<int>)>`; `get_Item(key)` → boxed ValueTuple →
   unbox → Item3 (`List<TableRandomDrop>`) at **offset +8** → per `TableRandomDrop` read `content`
   (`TableRewardItem[]`), **guard length>0**, `content[0]` → `rewardType`/`rewardParam`.
   **Do NOT call `RewardUtility.GetDropGroup`** — it does an unconditional `content[0]` and throws
   `IndexOutOfRange` on rows with empty content (e.g. TREE2032), silently dropping the rare group.
   Iterate **all** `hitProduce[i][j]` keys; a rare tree lists Timber + Quality + Rare Timber across slots.
   Pick the **highest-tier** = highest id within the primary item's 10000-family (rarity via `GetQuality`
   returns 1 for all tiers, so it can't rank — id does). Ignore out-of-family ids (e.g. bonus boxes 70xxx).
   **VALIDATE the id against the atlas** (`mapAtlasIdSet`, built from the runtime dump): the produce path can
   resolve a real drop-item id that has NO collectable sprite — meteors (produce 601/602/603 → Starfall Shard
   40034/40035/40036) are not in the 32-sprite atlas, and a `MapResource` track with such an id renders
   BLANK. Empty set (atlas not yet enumerated) = optimistic; self-corrects once the atlas loads because a
   type change re-dispatches the track.
2. **atlas-name match** (mushrooms: produceId=0, entity id 130005 has no collectable sprite). The radar
   LABEL is the item name ("Shiitake"); match it to the collectable atlas name→id map (built from the
   runtime atlas dump via `TableData.GetEntity(id).name`, the localized `TableEntity.name` property — use the
   unambiguous 2-param `GetEntity`, NOT `RewardUtility.GetName` which has two 3-param overloads incl. a Guid one).
3. **produce drop-item id NOT in the atlas** (meteor → Starfall Shard) — `Furniture` track with that item id:
   the item's NormalItem icon (`ui_item_normal_*`) exists for inventory items even when the collectable sprite
   doesn't (`via=produceItem`). Reaches the big map too, but only through the `IsSameType` widening below.
4. **entity static id fallback** — `EntityUtil.GetEntityResId(entity)` (managed EntityUtil absent → AuraMono;
   enumerate both 1-arg overloads, invoke with the entity object). Works only for mushroom-type gathers via
   NormalItem; trees/stones expose an object prefab (`p_tree_*` absent → blank).

### Track type chosen from the resolution
- (1) or (2) succeeded → **`MapResource`** track (icon in collectable atlas → shows on minimap **and** drives
  a big-map spot).
- (3) or (4) → **`Furniture`** track (NormalItem icon). Minimap by default; a big-map spot only for the labels
  in `IsBigMapFurnitureLabel` (currently just **Meteor**), which need the `IsSameType` detour below.
- Birds/Fish/Insect → `Bird`/`Fish`/`Insect` (theme_107/104/108). Players/morphs → `Player` (native pin).

Resolved icon id is cached per radar label (`mapTrackLabelIcon` + `mapTrackLabelProduce`), so distant /
streamed-out markers reuse it (the game only instantiates a `CollectableObjectComponent` near the player —
distant markers can't resolve a produce id on their own).

---

## Big-map specifics & the frame trade-off

The big map needs a `MapSpotData` spot per marker. To show many markers per-position with correct icons,
each spot needs a UNIQUE `usageId` (spots merge if they share `usageId`+category+reason) AND a matching track
to supply the icon. A matching track makes the spot `IsTracked` → the game draws a **rectangle frame**.
Therefore (pick two of three): many / real-icons / no-frame.
- **Per-position + icon** (what the toggle enables): unique `usageId` = low 32 bits of the marker token; the
  `MapResource` track carries `TargetNetId = usageId` so the spot matches it (`IsSameTrackPoint`:
  `usageId == TargetNetId`) and borrows `ui_dynamic_collectable_{itemId}`. → frame on each.
- **One-per-type, no frame**: bare spot with `usageId = itemId` (its own sprite, no track) — but spots merge.
- Frameless + per-position ⇒ blank icons (unique id has no sprite).

So **"Show on big map" is OFF by default** (no frames). Mushrooms reach the big map via the atlas-name path
(→ `MapResource`/48xxx).

### Meteors on the big map — the `IsSameType` widening

Item-icon track types (`Furniture` etc.) are absent from `TrackingSystem.IsSameType`, whose switch maps
`SpotEnum.Collectable` to `TrackType.MapResource` **only** — so out of the box a `Furniture` track can never
be found by `GetTrackData`, and its spot falls back to `ui_dynamic_collectable_{usageId}` (blank for a unique
per-position id). Meteors are stuck on `Furniture` because their produce (601-603 → dropGroup
`ROCK6010/6020/6030` → Starfall Shard **40034/40035/40036**) has **no collectable sprite**, so they were
minimap-only.

Fix (**live-confirmed 2026-08-04**): a trampoline `NativeDetour` on **`TrackingSystem.IsSameType(TrackData, SpotEnum)`**
(`EnsureFurnitureSpotPatch` / `IsSameTypeNative`) that additionally returns true for
`Furniture` ↔ `Collectable`; everything else calls the original. The spot then matches our track
(`IsSameTrackPoint`: `usageId == TargetNetId`, which the sync sets for every big-map-eligible marker) and
`MapSpot.GetAtlasSpriteID` returns `trackingItems[0].GetAtlasSpriteId()` = `AtlasEnum.NormalItem` /
`RewardUtility.GetIconName(40034)` → `ui_item_normal_p_material_mfragment_6` — the same icon the minimap
already shows. Notes:
- **Safe to widen globally**: no vanilla call site creates a `Collectable` spot (`SpotEnum.Collectable`
  appears only in reads), so the extra match can only ever reach our own markers.
- **ABI**: `TrackData` is a ~48-byte struct → Win64 passes it BY REFERENCE. `RCX=this`, `RDX=TrackData*`,
  `R8=SpotEnum`; read `TrackType` at the **raw** offset (`offTdTrackType`, header-subtracted). Mono managed
  methods carry no trailing `MethodInfo*` (that is IL2CPP).
- Installed on the `radarBigMapSpots` gate alone (inert without a `Collectable` spot), only once
  `EnsureMapTrackReady` has published the offset, and undone on toggle-off + `Cleanup()`. Hot path
  (per track × spot on every map refresh) → allocation-free, no logging.
- Which labels take this route is `IsBigMapFurnitureLabel` — deliberately just `"Meteor"`. Bird/Insect
  species pictures and `Contaminated` also ride `Furniture` and would work the same way if ever added.
- The tracked square is already suppressed for every `Collectable` spot by `MapSpotIsTrackedNative`.
- **`Animal` (23) rides the same widening** (2026-09-14, built, not yet live-confirmed): the "Gift Animal"
  label (WildAnimalVisitGiftFeature.cs) is dispatched as `TrackType.Animal`, whose sprite is fixed by the
  type — `AtlasEnum.Map` / `ui_dynamic_hud_map_mark_animalgroup`, the pink paw the game pins when you
  track a wild animal. `IsSameTypeNative` accepts `Furniture` **or** `Animal` for a `Collectable` spot, and
  the sync marks `Animal` tracks big-map eligible. Nothing else in the client keys off `TrackType.Animal`
  (only `TrackingItem`'s atlas/sprite switches; `GetTrackedWildAnimal` reads `Species`), and the
  minimap's only type filter is `IsTrackPet` (= `Pet`).
- The ESP tag cannot use the item-icon loaders for an atlas sprite, and `CopySpriteTexture` would copy the
  whole atlas page — `ui_dynamic_*` keys go through `TryGetRadarIconFromSpriteAtlas` (Radar.cs), a UV-space
  `Graphics.Blit` of `sprite.textureRect` out of the loaded `SpriteAtlas`.
Diag: `[MapSpots] big-map patch: Furniture->Collectable match installed on TrackingSystem.IsSameType`.

---

## Cooldown filtering (two layers)
1. `RadarMarkerMetadata.IsCooldown` — but the radar's own cooldown tracking is LOCAL/heuristic
   (`rareTreeCooldowns_res` etc.) and misses resources depleted by others / before login.
2. Authoritative: `CollectableObjectComponent.inCold` (bool property `get_inCold`, read via `TryGetMonoBoolMember`)
   into `MapResEntity.OnCooldown`; a matched-but-cooled marker is skipped (no marker, StopTrack-removed).
   Distant/streamed-out resources have no entity → fall back to layer 1.

---

## Player avatars on map markers

**Native mechanism (friends).** The map widgets show the real avatar photo when the spot's target is a
friend: `MiniMapSpotWidget.SetData` → `spot.IsFriend` → `HeadIconWidget` ("HeadIconWidget_Map") →
`SetIcon(url)` → `photo_widget.SetTexture(url, HeadIconDefinition)`, with
`url = FriendSystem.GetUserProfile(usageId).AvatarImageUrl`. Same gate on the big map:
`MapSpotWidget` → `MapSpot.IsFriend`. For a Player TRACK the widget's `usageId` = `TrackData.TargetNetId`
(`MiniMapSystem.GetMiniMapSpots`). The profile cache (`FriendSystem._userDataCache`) is warmed by VANILLA
for every player with a server Player spot (`MapSpotsSystem.CreateMapSpotData` →
`FriendSystem.UpdateUserCacheInMap(netId)`) — it is NOT friend-gated; only the `IsFriend` check is.

**Avatars for EVERYONE on the maps (`radarPlayerAvatarsAll`, opt-in).** Two callback-free NativeDetours on
the friend-gate getters, Apply/Undo following the toggle (Building-hook pattern: no trampoline, no managed
callbacks, allocation-free bodies):
- `MiniMapSpot.get_IsFriend` — STRUCT getter: `this` = raw struct data pointer → header-subtracted field
  offsets (`trackType` byte, `usageId` uint). Body: `trackType==Player && usageId!=0 && usageId!=self`.
- `MapSpot.get_IsFriend` — CLASS getter: `this` = object pointer → header-inclusive offsets (`category`
  int == SpotEnum.Player=3, `usageId` int). Same body semantics.
Self netId cached (`TryResolveSelfPlayerNetIdMono`, refreshed ~2 s). Non-player spots return false exactly
like vanilla. These getters are read ONLY by the map widgets (mini/big map) — clicking a player still opens
`PersonalInformationPanel` via the real `TryGetFriendByNetId`, so **dialogs treat strangers correctly** (no
friend-only leakage). Undone on toggle-off and in `Cleanup()`.

**IN-WORLD avatar pointer — SCOPED force-friend (re-enabled).** The world pointer (`MapTrackWidget.SetData`)
draws the avatar head icon only when `FriendProtocolManager.TryGetFriendByNetId(cell.NetID)` is true (else a
plain icon). That check routes through `IFriendService` → the concrete `FriendClientService.TryGetFriendByNetId`,
which is also used by ~30 dialog/panel call sites — so the first attempt (global force-friend) made strangers
look like friends everywhere and broke `PersonalInformationPanel`. **Fix: confine the override to the render
call.** A trampoline detour on `MapTrackWidget.SetData` (`EnsureTrackWidgetPatch`) sets `mapTrackWidgetRendering`
for the duration of that one call; `FriendGateNative` (the `TryGetFriendByNetId` detour, `EnsureFriendGatePatch`)
force-returns TRUE **only while that flag is set** AND the netId ∈ `mapAvatarWorldNetIds` (our injected world
players, self excluded). Every other caller runs with the flag clear → real result → no dialog leak. **The
friend check is read in TWO places at different times**, so both are bracketed (`EnsureTrackWidgetPatch` detours
both): `MapTrackCellModel.SetData(TrackingItem)` → `TrackingItem.GetAtlasSpriteId()` sets
`iconId.SpriteName = GetUserProfile(netId).AvatarImageUrl` (the avatar URL, loaded as a texture by
`HeadIconWidget.SetIcon(url)`), and `MapTrackWidget.SetData(MapPositionTrackBarModel)` picks the head-icon
branch. Bracketing only the widget (not the cell) gave a **blank white icon** — the URL was never stored. World
"Player" tracks are injected only while the toggle is on (`radarPlayerAvatarsAll`); Morphs stay tracked
regardless (hide-and-seek). Same reentrancy pattern as `mapNameReadingSelf`; save/restore flag for nesting.
Undone on toggle-off + `Cleanup()`.

**Big-map "tracked square" on players — suppressed.** Our Player track incidentally matches the vanilla
Player spot (`IsSameTrackPoint`: usageId == TargetNetId) → `MapSpot.IsTracked` = true → `MapSpotWidget`
activates `tracked_go` (a square frame) that a normal friend spot doesn't get. A trampoline detour on
`MapSpot.get_IsTracked` (`MapSpotIsTrackedNative`) keeps the real value except: (a) **Collectable** category
→ always false (vanilla never makes Collectable spots, so all are our big-map resource markers; the icon
still resolves via `GetAtlasSpriteID`/`GetTrackData`, which is independent of `IsTracked`); (b) **Player**
category with usageId ∈ `mapAvatarWorldNetIds` → false. Both lose the square and regain normal untracked
sort/LOD. This detour is managed independently of the avatar toggle — installed when `radarBigMapSpots ||
radarPlayerAvatarsAll` (via `EnsureIsTrackedPatch`, offsets from `TryEnsureMapSpotOffsets`), so resource
frames go away with just "Show on big map" on. `radarPlayerNamesAll` is deliberately **absent** from that
gate: the name group injects no world tracks, so it can never produce a spot needing the square suppressed.
The `bg_img` friend background stays (normal styling that real friends get too).

**Gotchas found:** `FriendClientService`'s C# namespace is `ClientSystem.Social.Friend` (the `EcsSystem`
prefix is only the ilspy folder = image name); and the managed `TryGetSelfPlayerNetId` returns 0 on this
build → use `TryResolveSelfPlayerNetIdMono` (AuraMono `PlayerDataCenter.GetSelfNetPlayerId`). Also:
`XDTGameUI`-image classes (`MapTrackWidget`, `MapTrackCellModel`) don't resolve through
`FindAuraMonoClassByFullName` (its across-assemblies search silently misses that image) — use the
`FindAuraMonoClassInAllLoadedImages(className, nameSpace)` fallback (args reversed) and always log which class
failed, or you get a stuck no-op with no install/error line (that was the "blank/placeholder avatar" bug).

## Real player names for non-friends (`radarPlayerNamesAll`)

The game shows strangers a **Title**, not their name. There is **no single lever** — different surfaces read the
name from different functions:
- **map spot label / chat** → `PlayerServiceSystem.GetPlayerName(shortId, title)`.
- **over-head nameplate** → `EntityTrackBarModel.TryGetName` (XDTGUI.Module.Track.Bars), which for a player does
  `GetUserProfile(shortId).Title.TitleString` (acquaintance → Title) or `return false` (non-acquaintance →
  **nothing**). It does NOT call GetPlayerName.
- **profile card** (`PersonalInformationPanel`) → renders `EditDesignation(playerProfile.Title)` for strangers.

The real name is `PlayerProfile.Name`, cached for all via `FriendSystem.GetUserProfile`. Implemented SAFELY (no
force-friend). TWO detours cover the surfaces:
- **Read name + shortId** in the throttled RemotePlayerComponent scan:
  `TryGetAuraMonoDataModuleInstance(FriendSystem)` → `get_Instance`; invoke `GetUserProfile` (two 1-arg
  overloads uint/long — probe both, keep whichever returns a populated profile); boxed struct → unbox → read
  `Name` and `Id` at raw offsets (`TryGetTrackFieldRawOffset`). `Id` is an ENCODED shortId string → decode to
  the raw shortId via `ShortIdUtil.DecodeShortId(string)->long` (STATIC, no out-param → the safe netId↔shortId
  bridge; avoids the `TryGetPlayerShortId(out long)` value-type-out crash risk). **Pin the name string BEFORE
  `TryReadMonoString`** (it allocates → a GC could move the unpinned name → stale pointer → crash). Cache
  `shortId → pinned MonoString`, swap in one assignment per scan, free previous pins.
- **map spot / chat** — trampoline detour on `PlayerServiceSystem.GetPlayerName(long, long)`
  (`GetPlayerNameNative`): shortId cached → return the real name, else original. Allocation-free.
- **over-head nameplate + card** — detour BOTH 1-arg `FriendSystem.GetUserProfile` overloads
  (`EnsureGetProfilePatch` / `MirrorProfileNameIntoTitle`). These return `PlayerProfile` **by value (sret)**; the
  hook calls the trampoline to fill the buffer, then mirrors `Name` → `Title._titleString` inside that returned
  copy so `Title.TitleString` yields the real name (the getter returns the `_titleString` backing field, rebuilt
  only on language change). Pure copy-mutation → the FriendSystem cache is untouched. Unconditional (Name
  non-empty) so no overload-arg disambiguation is needed. **sret ABI** (mono INSTANCE method, confirmed via
  crash dump): `this` comes first, THEN the return buffer → `RCX=this, RDX=sret, R8=arg` — mirror into the
  **2nd** pointer param (a *static* sret method like CraftMath has sret first because there's no `this`).
  Original returns the sret ptr in `RAX` → the hook delegate returns `IntPtr` (the trampoline result) to
  preserve RAX. A reentrancy flag (`mapNameReadingSelf`) suppresses the mirror while our own scan is inside
  `GetUserProfile` (the cache-read invoke re-enters the detour). Offsets `Name@8`, `Title@24`,
  `PlayerTitle._titleString@16` → `Title.str@40`; MonoString `length@16` must be >0 (else you'd blank the title
  = the empty-nameplate bug). Allocation-free (Marshal ops).
- **nameplate acquaintance gate** — `TryGetName` only returns a name for friends/acquaintances/hide-seek; a plain
  stranger hits `return false` (empty) until you open their card (which registers them as an acquaintance). So
  detour `FriendSystem.IsAcquaintance(long shortId)` (`EnsureIsAcquaintancePatch` / `IsAcquaintanceNative`) → `1`
  for players in the name cache, else original. `IsAcquaintance`'s ONLY external caller is this nameplate (no
  social/action gating — safe, unlike the reverted force-friend). Now the name shows without opening the card.
- Overrides friends too (real name instead of nickname — low risk, informative; friends' over-head still uses
  NickName); self excluded (RemotePlayerComponent is remote-only). Managed by the `radarPlayerNamesAll` toggle
  (`mapNameActive` gates all hooks); GetUserProfile + IsAcquaintance detours undone in `Cleanup`.
- **Shared with the avatar group: the scan, nothing else.** `RefreshRemotePlayerScan` builds BOTH the
  `shortId → name` cache used here AND `mapAvatarUrlByNetId`, which is where the ESP overlay reads a player
  marker's avatar URL from (`HeartopiaResourceVisualEsp.TryGetPlayerAvatarTexture`). So
  `ManagePlayerAvatarPatches` runs it under `avatars || names`, **before** either group's branch — hanging it
  off the names branch alone blanks ESP avatars for anyone running avatars-on/names-off. It self-throttles on
  `mapPlayerNextScanAt` (1 s), so this caller and the track-sync one cost a single scan per interval. No
  detour is shared between the groups, and this group force-friends nothing.
Diag: `[MapSpots] name read: … Title.str@40 …` and `name patch: GetUserProfile Title-mirror detour installed on
N overload(s)`.

## Key crash-safety notes
- All AuraMono invokes: `EnsureAuraMonoApiReady` / `AttachAuraMonoThread`, exc check, no MonoObject* held
  across yields/frames (this all runs synchronously inside the sync pass).
- `mono_runtime_invoke` arg convention: value types by pointer (`args[i] = &value`; Vector3/int/enum/bool),
  reference types as the object pointer directly (`args[i] = strObj`). Struct **out** params are unsafe
  (stack corruption) — only reference-type out/returns; boxed value **returns** are fine (unbox).
- ValueTuple after unbox: fields at sequential offsets from the unboxed data pointer.


## Markers for resources you cannot collect

A marker **is not created at all** when the resource cannot currently be gathered. A depleted one
used to be drawn with the `_cooldown` mesh; that was right while a cooldown was a node's only
possible trouble, and wrong for dynamic bushes: a growing mushroom reads `inCold=False` on its
component and was drawn as an ordinary available one (see `docs/FARM_WALK_TO_NODE.md` §7b).

The check (`IsGatherableHiddenFromMarkers`) asks three questions:

* the component says "depleted" → hide it;
* the client's verdict says "not ready yet" → hide it (this is the growing case);
* a dynamic bush **with no verdict** → hide it, it is unconfirmed.

The last one hides a bush for a second or two until the sweep answers — a marker that may turn out
to be a growing stub is worse than a marker that appeared a moment later.

⚠️ The check sits **in marker creation**, and that is deliberate: radar markers are the shared
source for the ESP overlay, the game-map sync and the farm's candidate set. One hide removes the
resource from all three at once. The number hidden is printed in the scan line:
`land radar: marked 12 (hid 5 not collectable) of 142`.

### The icon resolves on the narrow radius

A marker's icon comes from the entity found by **positional matching**, and the radius for it is
the same tight identification radius the cooldown filter uses (`MapResCooldownMatchSqr`), not the
general three-metre one. With the loose radius, collecting a resource produced a visible glitch:
the entity disappears, the nearest survivor turns out to be a tree a couple of metres away, and for
one tick the marker took that tree's icon before being removed itself — a mushroom on the map
flickered into a tree. Beyond the identification radius a marker keeps its previous icon rather
than borrowing a neighbour's.
