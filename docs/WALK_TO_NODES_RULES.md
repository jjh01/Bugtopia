# Walk to Nodes: the rules

Normative document: **how the mode is supposed to behave**. Distinct from
[FARM_WALK_ROUTING.md](FARM_WALK_ROUTING.md), which describes *what the code does*, step by step.

Every rule is numbered so it can be cited. Tags:
**[M]** — measured in game, the number is confirmed;
**[J]** — a judgement call, nothing measured behind it;
**[?]** — in doubt, needs checking.

## 0. General (all modes)

**0.1** Movement goes through the joystick axis only (`TrySetGameMoveAxis`). Position is never
written directly — the server must see ordinary travel. **[M]**

**0.2** A teleport is an emergency exit, not a means of travel. Permitted **only** when the walk has
spent its budget **and** this is the only target.

**0.2a** ⭐ **Never teleport to a target the router can reach.** Every destination is offered to the
router first, and the teleport is what is left when no route can be built — not a shortcut taken
because the previous walk gave up.

"the walk gave up" and "there is no way there" are different facts, and confusing them is what this
rule exists to stop. Measured 2026-08-23: a walk reached **0.3 m** from the end of its route and quit
only because the bubble hung 2.2 m overhead — nothing to do with the route. Ninety seconds later the
skip-reclaim branch warped 40 m to that same node, which the graph could route to perfectly well.

Applies to **every** destination without exception — node reclaims, priority-location moves, and the
farm's own startup positioning. Before this, `Walk to Zone Point` meant "walk between farm zones,
except when the priority list moves you", and switching the farm on warped you to the priority
location with no attempt at all. **[M]**

**0.2a-audit** Nine teleport sites in the farm and two in the walker. All nine farm sites now offer
the destination to the router first. The two in the walker — `node:walk-rescue` and
`node:walk-fallback` — fire only after a walk has RUN and failed, which is the emergency exit 0.2
allows and not an exception to 0.2a. Any new `FarmTeleportTo` belongs in one of those two shapes.

⚠️ A walk branch must do **the same bookkeeping the teleport did**. Arriving on foot is still
arriving: `currentPriorityLocation` is what the collect cycle reads to decide whether a location
keeps its slot, and `lastTeleportWasPriorityLocation` gates that check at all — its name is
historical and means "this cycle belongs to a priority location", not "we warped". The first cut of
0.2a broke out of the switch before both assignments. **[M]**

**0.2b** The escape hatch for 0.2a is a **failure ladder**, not an exception: a node that fails again
within the repeat-offender window of a reclaim is parked for five minutes rather than reclaimed a
second time. Without that, "walk if a route exists" is a livelock — the route exists every time. **[M]**

**0.3** Exactly one owner writes the axis each frame. While an apex escape runs, ordinary steering
stays silent; every other unstick phase, conversely, takes its direction from **inside** the
steering. **[M]**

**0.4** Arrival is judged by the aura's trigger radius — **1.5 m** — not by zero distance. The walker
stops at a **stand-off**, not on top of the node: driving in to 0.25 m made the last metre the
expensive part of every walk. **[M]**

**0.4-poop** A dog dropping the poop scan can see (`PetPoopFeature.cs`) is **always the next
target**, ahead of every priority row and without a switch of its own (owner's call, 2026-09-12): it
is worth more than any bush and it expires. It is a `node:poop` walk with dwell label `Dog Poop`;
the dwell is judged by the dropping's **netId leaving the scan**, never by a marker or a
`CollectColdEvent` (a pickable has neither), capped at 25 s for the server's 8-15 s grace. A dropping
the router cannot reach, or one still there after the cap, is **parked for 5 minutes, never warped
to** — 0.2a's emergency exit is for the ONLY target, and a dropping is never that. The pickup itself
is the feature's 2 m send loop, which runs whenever the foraging farm or Aura Farm is on. **[M]**

**0.4a** The stand-off is **per resource kind and learned, not assumed**. It starts at **1.1 m**.
Measured 2026-08-22: Raspberry, Ore, Stone and Mandarin Tree all collected from ~1.05 m while a
Button mushroom at 1.03 m did not — so there is no single right number, and nothing is assumed about
the kinds that already work. **[M]**

**0.4b** A kind that times out with its marker still available **steps in by 0.3 m and retries the
same node**, up to 4 steps, floored at 0.25 m — below which we are standing on the node, which is
what the stand-off exists to avoid. Learning a number and walking away means the node that taught
the lesson is lost, and if the new number is still too far the next one is lost as well. Stepping in
on the node in hand costs seconds and finds the real distance rather than a safe guess: Button
settled at **0.8 m** in one step, where a single jump to a safe value had used 0.5 m. The step budget
is per stubborn node — a successful collect resets it — while the learned distance persists. **[M]**

**0.4c** Every arrival test uses the learned stand-off, including the "height not closed but still in
reach" fallback. That fallback kept a global 1.4 m after the walk had already proved the kind does
not collect from 1.1 m, and accepted an arrival at 1.37 m that collected nothing. **[M]**

**0.5** A target is judged **only** by an authority that knows something about it. The collectable
scan rules on `node:` walks alone; `quest:`, `cleanse:`, `area:` and bubbles are outside its
jurisdiction. Stated as a positive rule rather than a list of exceptions — the list turned out
incomplete four times running. **[M]**

**0.6** No route built — take **another target**, not a teleport. The node is parked for 45 s and
returns to the plan. **[J]**

**0.7** In walk mode the target is chosen by **route length**, not by straight line. Teleport mode
keeps the straight line: a warp costs the same from anywhere. **[J]**

**0.6-stamps** ⭐ **A run reset clears bans, never cooldowns.** `recentlyVisitedNodes` carried two
different facts under one name: "this node is cold until T", which is a statement about the WORLD
with an expiry read from the entity itself, and "the walker could not get here", which is a
heuristic of the RUN. Stop/Start wiped both, so a resource the farm had just drained counted as
available again and the farm walked back to check it on foot — measured 04:55:56, a 131 m haul to a
zone emptied four minutes earlier, which then reported nothing and moved on.

Only stamps raised because the node could not be REACHED are cleared: no route, repeat-offender
park, walk skip. Everything a collect or a cooldown produced survives the toggle. **[M]**

**0.7-hold** ⭐ **A target, once chosen, is held.** The head of the tour is not re-picked while a
walk to it is running. Consumable targets (bubbles) were re-ranked by straight line from the
player's CURRENT position on every call, so walking towards one changed the distances to both and
the choice flipped. Measured 02:55–02:57: A → B → A → B, each switch discarding a built route; two
minutes produced no collect at all, and the one bubble that disappeared popped on its own.

Nothing logged an error, because nothing was wrong by any single check — which is why this reads as
"it is just walking" until the targets are listed side by side.

Switching is allowed only when the new candidate is nearer by a **margin** (25 m), never by any
amount: bubbles drift ~1.5 m/s and the player's own movement changes both distances every tick, so
an unmargined comparison oscillates by construction. The hold is released when the target leaves the
stop list — collected, popped, parked or pruned — which every one of those paths already does. **[M]**

**0.7a** The measurement must **reproduce the builder**, not approximate it: the same reachable start
snap, the same corner shortcutting. Otherwise it compares numbers that are not comparable — raw A\*
output over a sparse graph reported "34 m away costs 266 m to travel" for a swim the walker would
have taken in one straight leg. **[M]**

**0.7b** A candidate whose route **could not be measured** is not dropped: it is ranked by straight
line with a penalty. Unreachability is proved by a failed walk (§0.6), not by the measurer's
silence. **[M]**

**0.7c** A measurement exceeding **three times the straight line** is not a route, it is the graph's
sparseness: treated as unmeasured. **[M]**

**0.7d** The nearest by straight line keeps the pick unless the winner is better by **20 % and at
least 5 m**. Otherwise the metric's own error decides: one run took a target 48 m away over one
39 m away to save two metres. **[M]**

**0.7e** Candidates are measured in straight-line order and the search **stops on a bound**, not on a
count: once the best measured route is no longer than the straight line to the next candidate,
nothing remaining can win, because a route is never shorter than its straight line. A fixed
shortlist of four was a cost guess with nothing behind it — and on land it silently became "the
first four stops of the planned circuit", which is a route order, not a distance ranking. The
remaining cap (12) is a backstop against a pathological field, not the policy. **[M]**

**0.8** Every heuristic (bans, exclusions, filters) must have a starvation valve: it may never make
routing impossible. **[M]**

**0.9** After a collect — hold in place for **1.5 s** so the drop can be picked up. **[?]** This is a
hold, not a confirmation: nothing watches an item reach the bag.

**0.10** Everything the mod decided and did not do goes into the log with its reason. A silent
refusal is forbidden — over one session it masked a real defect as "all clear" three times.

**0.11** Any deliberate hold (repair aura, collect dwell, drop pickup) must suspend the progress and
stuck detectors. Those timers measure failure, not a pause: eighteen seconds of standing in a repair
aura, exactly as instructed, once ended in a rescue teleport. **[M]**

**0.12a** This document, the walker's code and its log lines are written in **English**, like the
rest of the repository. A rule that cannot be read by everyone reviewing the walker is not a rule.

**0.13** Every position the walker or its drivers measure comes from the **self player entity**, never
from `GetLocalPlayer()` / `GameObject.Find("p_player_skeleton(Clone)")`. Remote players share that
object name and the first match wins, so near a quest NPC — where strangers always stand — the driver
measures one body while steering another: "arrived (0.8 m)" with the real character forty metres out.

**0.14** A failure latch that stops *driving* must also stop the *walk*. The injected move axis is
stateful — the game holds the last value until something releases it, and every release site sits
inside the tick the latch just disabled. Freezing the driver alone leaves the character running in
the last steered direction with the out-of-bounds guard still suppressed. **[M]**

**0.15** A component that hands the walker a route from outside must be able to tell **its own
injection from the walker's correction**. Both change the corner count, so counting corners cannot
distinguish them; carry a sequence the walker bumps when it re-paths itself. Without it the walker's
route around an obstacle is overwritten by the route that hit the obstacle, every frame, and the leg
can only end by teleport — rule 0.2a breached from the outside. **[M]**

**0.12** A stop leaves the plan when the *latest scan's candidate list* no longer holds a marker
there — never on the strength of the collectable cold-scan alone. That scan covers only the seven
`MapResGather` families, so pollution and bubbles are missing from it *by construction*, and reading
their absence as "already collected" drops every contaminated target the moment the player swims
within proof range. Judge every kind by the same list that produced it. **[M]**

## 1. Building a route

**1.1** Order: snap the start → snap the end → A\* over the waypoint graph → append the real target →
degenerate-route check → edge audit → corner shortcutting → choose the starting corner.

**1.2** The start snap takes not the nearest node but the nearest **reachable** one: a ray on the
Passable mask **and** the ground profile (step ≤ 0.5 m per sample). Radius 60 m, up to 12
candidates. **[M]**

**1.3** The end snap stays on the nearest node: the last leg decides there, and the walker handles
that itself.

**1.4** A\* skips banned nodes. The end node is exempt — refusing to arrive where we were asked is
failing the route, not routing around an obstacle. **[M]**

**1.5** Edge audit: every leg is checked by the sweep **and** the ground profile. An impassable leg →
ban the waypoint it ends at, and rebuild. No more than **2** attempts per build.

**1.5a** The sweep runs at **two heights**: the capsule's centre (0.63 m) and knee height
(**0.30 m** = stepOffset + radius). One sphere in the middle is not a player — a rail or kerb below
0.48 m passes under it and reports clear, and the player walks into it. **[M]**

**1.5b** A leg is passable only when it is passable **in both directions**. Confirmed in game
2026-08-22: standing against a barrier, walking away from it is free while walking into it from open
ground is blocked, because the sphere is built **at the origin** and a collider it already touches
there is discarded by the cast. A leg that begins beside a wall therefore reports clear and the walk
hits that wall on its first step. **[M]**

**1.5c** Both directions of that comparison must be **levelled** — the oracle lifts only its origin
(radius + 0.05), so the raw two directions are different tilted segments and their disagreement is
the call, not the world. Pre-lower the origin by the same amount. Measured with and without: 228
asymmetric edges vs 229, so the tilt does not explain the result — but it has to be removed before
that can be said. **[M]**

**1.5d** Only a **near-level** leg (rise ≤ 0.5 m) is rejected for being one-way. Asymmetry appears on
any slope for a harmless reason — from the lower end the sphere already rests on the ground — and
unfiltered that gave **229** asymmetric edges against **2** once level ground was required. Steeper
disagreements are logged, never banned. **[J]**

**1.5e** A **solid column** — no height in the span where the capsule fits — standing in a leg makes
it impassable. This is the shape the barriers on the shore and on the rope bridge take, and neither
has a collider to find. ⚠️ Solid at the TOP is not a solid column: rejecting on that alone bans every
leg passing under a bridge deck or an arch. Keep descending until free air is found. **[M]**

**1.5f** ⭐ **The audit runs underwater too — the SWEEP does.** It used to be switched off entirely
while swimming, with no comment saying why. The reason can only have been the ground profile: a
swimmer has no floor, so the step test would refuse every leg over open water. That is an argument
against the profile, not against the sweep — "can this body pass from A to B" is exactly the
question when swimming, and it was the one nobody asked. Swimming now skips the knee sweep and the
ground profile and keeps the sweep. **[M]**

**1.5g** ⭐ **A detour is audited before it is committed**, with `includeFirstLeg: true`. The builder
tested exactly one leg — last waypoint to target — and never the leg the walker actually takes
first, in the one route whose entire reason for existing is that the straight line is blocked.
Committing also returns straight out of the route builder, so the ordinary edge audit never saw a
detour either, on land or under water.

Measured 02:42:52, a Glasswort 2.6 m away: beeline correctly refused as blocked, three-corner detour
built, first corner 10 m down through a wall, swimmer drove into it, backed off, repeated every four
seconds. ⚠️ A 10 m dive is NORMAL and must not be "fixed" — a proportionality bound on detour length
was tried here and was wrong. The wall in front of the dive was the defect. **[M]**

**1.6** A ban is **never** issued on leg zero: it starts at the player and speaks about where they
are standing, not about the graph. Eight false bans in six seconds came from exactly that. **[M]**

**1.7** Nor on the final leg: it ends at the resource, and there is nothing there to take off the
table.

**1.8** No more than **2** bans per walk. More than that means the test is wrong, not the graph. **[J]**

**1.9** Shortcutting: only the first corner is removed, and only if the ray is clear **at foot level
and at +1.2 m**. At most 3 per build, span ≤ 10 m. Taking "the furthest visible corner" is
forbidden — that collapsed routes into a straight line through buildings. **[M]**

**1.10** The starting corner is the first one genuinely ahead, not index zero.

**1.11** The game's own route (Quest Walk injects it wholesale) is checked by the same rules. On an
impassable leg — including leg zero — it is **rejected** and ours is built instead. A route once
rejected is never injected again: the game refreshes it every few seconds and would overwrite
ours. **[M]**

---

## 1a. Re-pathing

**1a.1** A re-path is triggered by **three causes only**, and there must be no others:
* **off the corridor** — deviation from the segment "leg start → current corner" over 4 m;
* **not closing** — half of the no-progress timeout;
* **safety cadence** — a long timer, so that "never re-path at all" does not become its own trap.

**1a.2** The corridor is measured from `farmWalkLegStart` to the current corner, **in XZ**. Hence the
obligation: **every** route builder sets `farmWalkLegStart`. The direct-swim branch did not, the
corridor measured against the previous route's point, and "off the corridor" fired **every second**
on a perfectly straight swim. **[M]**

**1a.3** A re-path that changed nothing (`IDENTICAL`) is a **symptom**, not work. If it repeats, the
trigger is broken, not the graph.

**1a.4** Three futile re-paths in a row ban a waypoint. So a false trigger does not merely make
noise — it **corrupts the graph**: seventeen underwater bans came from a broken corridor, not from
geometry. Every change to the triggers must be checked against this chain. **[M]**

**1a.5** The route is never rebuilt while an escape runs: the escape captured its aim at the start
and measures every hop against it. **[M]**

**1a.6** No more than once per second, whatever the reason. **[M]**

**1a.7** A new route is accepted only if it is at least 0.5 m shorter. Identical, or "reshuffled but
no shorter", is rejected: that was the cause of a live 3↔5 corner lock. **[M]**

**1a.8** The verdict is written in words — `IDENTICAL` / `RESHUFFLED, no shorter` / `N.Nm shorter`.
Without it, "re-pathed" is indistinguishable from "twitched". **[M]**

---

## 2. On foot

**2.1** Walking climbs a **0.15 m** step (`stepOffset`). A slope up to **0.5 m** per sample counts as
walkable. A jump clears **1.42 m**. Above that, nothing does. **[M]**

**2.2** Judging a route by the jump ceiling is forbidden: that is what an escape drags out of the
body in extremis, not what walking does.

**2.3** The escape ladder, in order:
1. **a plain running jump** — an impulse every 0.35 s, axis held at the aim, ending the moment it has
   cleared the obstacle (§5.8) and at 1.5 s regardless;
2. **press 45°**, then −45° — looking for a corner;
3. **apex hops** on headings 0 / ±45° from the wedge.

**2.4** Jumping and moving are **incompatible**: an axis pressed into an obstacle suppresses the jump
(43 impulses → 0.16 m of travel, the body never left the ground). So the axis is released **before**
the impulse. **[M]**

**2.5** Steer **at the top of the arc**, 0.4 s after the impulse, not at lift-off: the same heading
gained +4.00 m of height when the axis went in at the apex and +0.36 m at lift-off. **[M]**

**2.6** The steer is released on touchdown. Holding it through a landing suppresses the next jump.

**2.7** The steering direction is **frozen** for the whole attempt. A constant angle off a live
bearing is a circle, not a diagonal: against an aim two metres away one lap closes in six
seconds. **[M]**

**2.8** A heading that pays is repeated — up to 6 times. Success is ≥1 m of closing; a series that
has already earned its metre is carried to the end.

**2.9** A press that runs free (≥3 m without wedging) means **there is no obstacle**. The escape ends
immediately. **[M]**

**2.10** No more than **3** escapes per walk; one escape's budget is 22 s.

**2.11** **[?]** Horizontal closing counts as success even while descending. Jumps downhill always
earn it — the criterion is worth revisiting.

**2.12** **Below is not a dead end.** A node the walker cannot close vertically is abandoned only
when it is ABOVE: 3.6 m of climb is beyond every action the walker owns. Downwards the player simply
steps off and falls, which costs nothing — so with the horizontal already closed, the walker keeps
going along the direction it **arrived on** until the ground runs out. Two attempts, 1.6 s each; the
budget is against a node that is below because it sits under solid rock, where walking on only meets
more ground. Measured 2026-08-22: two nodes skipped in thirteen seconds, one of them a 1.5 m step
down. **[M]**

**2.12a** The drop pushes only until the ground goes away. Once the body is falling the axis has
nothing left to contribute, and holding it carries the player clear over the node — who lands past it
and turns back. Stepping off is a push followed by a release (§5.8). **[M]**

**2.12b** Where the node is below and the horizontal is closed, the **drop outranks a running
escape** — it does not wait for it. One owner per frame is the rule (§0.3); which owner is the
question, and a hop burst is for horizontal obstacles with nothing to offer against a node three
metres down. Deferring to the escape instead killed the drop outright, because the stuck detector
fires first and an escape is therefore always already running by the time the branch is reached. **[M]**

**2.13** Steering at the target is useless once the horizontal is closed — the delta is nothing and
there is no direction left in it. The direction that leaves a ledge is the one the walk **came in
on** (`farmWalkLegStart → target`). **[M]**

**2.14** A stuck strike may not be scored in the first **1.5 s** of a walk. A strike is 0.15 m missed
in a 0.6 s window and a single strike launches an escape — but the body has just stopped from the
previous walk and is still turning and accelerating, so the first window reads as no progress on open
ground. One walk was declared wedged at 12.9 m one second after starting, and the press then proved
there had never been an obstacle. **[M]**

---

## 3. In a vehicle

**3.0-seat** ⚠️ **The seat belongs to the JOURNEY, not to an aim point.** Aborting a walk dismounts,
which is right when the walk is over and wrong when it is being replaced in the same breath. A quest
point that shifted twenty metres cost a dismount and a re-summon with a hundred and seventy metres
still to drive — six seconds in the car, and the re-summon is another server round-trip plus the
mount window before anything moves. `AbortFarmWalk(keepVehicle: true)` is for a caller that starts
the next leg immediately; the arrival dismount is distance-driven, so a short new leg still gets
out by itself. **[M]**

**3.0-budget** ⚠️ **The reverse-and-sidestep budget belongs to an OBSTACLE, not to a ride.** The
round counter was zeroed on mount and on dismount and nowhere else, so two unrelated obstacles tens
of metres apart spent both rounds and the third wedge threw the driver out — while the log itself
showed each manoeuvre finishing `(clear)` and 38 m of driving in between, i.e. both rounds had
worked and the message saying they had not was false. Driving clear of where the manoeuvre started
(15 m, comfortably past the 2 m + 5 m of the manoeuvre itself) returns the budget. **[M]**

**3.0-settle** ⚠️ **Mounting and dismounting are both server round-trips, and BOTH need a settle
window.** The summon side has always had one: `IsFarmWalkRidingVehicle` answers "no" for a moment
after a successful mount, and without a cooldown the next walk summoned again. The dismount side had
none, so it answers "yes" for a moment after getting out — and the escape ladder, which asks "am I
driving?" first, ran another reverse-and-sidestep round on a player standing on their own feet.
Measured 05:37:04, one second apart:

```
dismounted from netId 2336382 (stuck in the vehicle).
wedged (not closing) - round 1/2: reversing 2m, then 5m to the right.
```

That is exactly what the dismount exists to prevent — it gets out so the ON-FOOT ladder can have the
obstacle. Escape sites ask `IsFarmWalkVehicleSteering()`, never `IsFarmWalkRidingVehicle()`. **[M]**


**3.1** A car does not jump. The apex escape does not apply to it at all, and the delegation sits
**inside** `BeginFarmWalkHopBurst` so that a new call site cannot forget. **[M]**

**3.2** The driver's ladder: reverse **2 m** → pull out sideways **5 m**, sides alternating per
round, **2** rounds. Each leg ends on distance covered; the 4 s timer is only for "blocked this way
too".

**3.3** Two rounds did not clear it — **get out**, and the on-foot ladder takes over. If the obstacle
is then cleared on foot and enough distance to the target remains, the vehicle is **remounted**.

**3.4** Dismounting happens **before** the destination, not on top of it: the last stretch is on foot
regardless.

**3.5** **[?]** Leg passability for a vehicle is tested exactly as for a pedestrian, though its
footprint and clearance differ. Nothing measured.

---

## 4. Underwater

**4.1** Distances are computed **in 3-D**. Descending *is* travel, and the spread of depths exceeds
the spread in the horizontal. On land it is the reverse — flat. **[M]**

**4.2** If the straight line to the target is clear by the sweep and the target is within **50 m** —
swim straight, **no graph needed**. The sweep is finally the right instrument here: its flaw on land
is that it flies over terrain, and a swimmer does precisely that. **[M]**

**4.2a** **[?] NOT IMPLEMENTED.** A straight swim should **follow the depth along the track** rather
than diving or surfacing all the way. An attempt to do that by interpolating depth against
horizontal progress (2026-08-22) was rejected — it behaved worse than before. Depth control still
aims at the **target's** depth, not the line's.

**4.3** The 50 m limit exists because a single sweep vouching for a two-hundred-metre crossing is a
bet, not a measurement. **[J]**

**4.4** The target chosen is the **nearest**, not the next in the plan: the underwater graph has 86
nodes against 1745 on land, with 20–30 m between them, and an order computed from distances is
worthless there. **[M]**

**4.5** During a swim, every 2 s it is checked whether something has become materially nearer.
Switching requires: the candidate is ≥6 m nearer **and** within 60 % of what remains **and** there is
still ≥12 m to swim. The abandoned target is not stamped visited. **[J]**

**4.6** Passability checks and waypoint bans **do not apply** underwater: the vertical is free there,
a 2.65 m ledge is not an obstacle, and the sweep's verdict would ban perfectly good nodes. **[M]**

**4.7** No ground under a sample is **not a verdict**. An empty column is air **or water**, and
nothing distinguishes them: there is no water level to query for an arbitrary point. Banning a ford
over that would be a mistake. **[M]**

**4.8** The apex escape does not run underwater: it is built entirely on leaving the ground and
landing again. There is its own ladder — back off 5 m, a vertical leg, a 4-direction probe. **[M]**

**4.9** Depth: engage band 0.35 m, release band 0.12 m, re-asserted once a second. The descent
deferral carries 0.75 m of hysteresis and is dropped for good the moment a walk has had to unstick
even once. **[M]**

**4.10** **[?]** One depth hold moves about 0.72 m — more than the deadband. Near the last metre the
controller never settles and oscillates. Not fixed.

**4.11** ⭐ **The Ocean Cleanup safe-zone dash swims straight, always** — label `cleanupboss:safezone`
takes `corners = [target]` with no sweep and no graph, on the first build and on every re-path. The
countdown is 8 s and the bubble sits 8–23 m away; a graph detour or a blocked-sweep refusal costs the
bubble, and the explosion then throws the player across the arena. Four fights, twelve dashes: the
eleven straight ones reached the bubble with 2.2–5.2 s to spare; the one the sweep refused (the line
ran 1.2 m from the boss centre, 01:16:41) went to the graph, which led 20 m the wrong way, and the
bubble was missed. **The boss on the line is not an obstacle.** Every dash in the recorder
(2026-09-15 manual, 2026-09-16 automatic) whose straight line ran 0.2-4.9 m from the boss centre
reached the bubble — twelve of them, e.g. 1.3 m → 1.7 m from the centre at the explosion, 0.2 m →
fine. Its collider only fools the sweep, which is exactly why the sweep is bypassed here. A one-bend
detour round the boss was tried on 2026-09-16 and removed the same night: the bend point got its
height re-anchored onto a pollutant 5 m up (the walker's live-entity height refine, now skipped for
`cleanupboss:*` walks) and the leg cost 4.7 of the 8 s. **[M]**

## 5. Forbidden

**5.1** Judging passability by the sweep **alone** or the ray **alone**: both fly over terrain when
the ends differ in height. The ground profile decides. **[M]**

**5.2** Reading "no ground" as "no way through". **[M]** An empty column is air **or** water and
nothing here separates them; a column where the capsule fits **nowhere** is a different answer
entirely (1.5e), and folding the two together is what hid every wall the collider table cannot see.

**5.2a** Testing passability in **one direction only**. It cannot see a one-way barrier, which is
what the game's own collision query produces wherever a sweep starts against something. **[M]**

**5.2b** Treating the collider table as the authority on obstacles. Measured twice with the player
pressed against a barrier: **zero** blocking colliders within 4–5 m. Terrain and built structures
are not in it. Use it to NAME what was hit, never to decide whether something is there. **[M]**

**5.3** Banning a waypoint on a leg that starts at the player. **[M]**

**5.4** Committing to a target whose reachability is unknown while an authority for it exists and was
not asked.

**5.5** Teleporting instead of changing target.

**5.6** Staying silent about a decision that was made.

**5.7** Encoding as a constant something the game can be made to tell us. A number that a failure
already reveals — the stand-off of §0.4a is the worked example — should be learned from that failure,
not guessed once and defended afterwards.

**5.8** Ending an action on a timer when it has a testable outcome. A timer is a **limit**, not a
criterion: it says "stop trying", never "it worked". Three of these shipped in one day and each cost
seconds of visible nonsense — the plain jump pulsed for its full 1.5 s after the first jump had
already cleared the kerb; the ledge drop pushed for its full 1.6 s and carried the player past the
node, who then turned back; the press ran its distance instead of stopping at the wedge. Ask for the
outcome, and keep the timer only as the backstop for when the outcome never arrives. **[M]**
