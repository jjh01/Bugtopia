## Global Controls

### Menu

- **Toggle menu:** Insert (default), rebindable in Settings. The mod toasts the current key once at startup, while the game is still booting (`StartupMenuHintFeature.cs`); it follows the Notifications toggle below.
- **Disable all:** Optional hotkey stops active farms and automation.
- **Status overlay:** Optional HUD showing active features and farm states.
- **Notifications:** Toast-style messages inside the mod UI (position configurable).

### Game speed

Hotkeys (all rebindable, default unbound):

- 1×, 2×, 5×, 10× game speed presets
- Slider in Features → Main; affects `Time.timeScale` clamped 1–10.

### Tool equip hotkeys

Quick-equip (when bound):

- Axe, insect net, fishing rod, sprinkler, bird scanner, building pad

### Hotkey suppression while typing

Whenever a game text field is focused (chat, renaming, search boxes, mail, …) **all mod hotkeys are
disabled except the menu toggle** — so typing a message never accidentally triggers a feature, and
you can still open/close the mod menu. Instrument note-keys are likewise suppressed while an
instrument panel is open. Both are automatic, no configuration needed (`InstrumentHotkeyGuardFeature.cs`).

### Pad build hotkeys (`PadBuildHotkeyFeature.cs`)

Keyboard control of the building pad without touching the on-screen `BuildStatusPanel` buttons. Five rebindable keys (Settings → Keybinds, default unbound):

| Key | Action | Behaviour |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Pad Confirm | `BuildModule.ConfirmPlacing(false)` | Places the held object (panel hold-button parity) |
| Pad Cancel | `BuildModule.CancelPlacing()` | Cancels current placing |
| Pad Rotate | `BuildModule.RotateAround()` | Rotates the held object; 250 ms debounce |
| Pad Move | `BuildModule.InteractExecuteMove()` | Picks up the focused object for moving; no-op in god mode (grab is a click there) |
| Pad Delete | Pad mode: `InteractExecutePickup()` (pack to backpack); god mode: `InteractExecuteDelete()` (wreck) | Removes the focused object |

All five are gated on `BuildModule.SubState == CraftState.Focus` — in simple Pad free-roam (no object focused/being placed) every key is a **silent no-op**. Works in both homeland build modes (Pad/TPS and god top-down view).

Implementation is a three-tier `BuildModule` resolution (managed → AuraMono `Managers.GetModule(Type)` → UI button clicks); see [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md) and [plans/2026-06-10-pad-build-api-migration.md](./plans/2026-06-10-pad-build-api-migration.md). Debug log flag: `MasterLogPadBuild`.

## Self Tab

### Camera Toggle (Mouse Look)

- Orbits camera around player with mouse capture.
- Optional crosshair.
- Restores default camera snapshot when disabled.
- Uses direct camera transform updates in `OnLateUpdate`.

### Noclip

- On foot: drives the game's own `PlayerMoveComponent` every frame through AuraMono (no Harmony
  patch — see [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) "anti-cheat surface cleanup"); `entity.position` feeds
  `TrySendSelfTransform`, so the server sees it like normal movement.
- Movement: WASD, Space/Ctrl vertical, Shift = speed boost multiplier.
- Speed and boost configurable; persisted in config.
- Blocks normal character controller motion while active.
- **Sync Position To Server** (toggle directly under Noclip, persisted, default **on**) — posts the
  driven transform at the game's own 20 Hz movement tick (`VehicleConst.VehicleMotionParam.MovementTickInterval`)
  so the server and other players follow the flight instead of seeing it land in one jump:
  - *vehicle*: the hold is `VehicleComponent.ForceDisplacement(true)` + `stopMove`, which also parks
    the game's own poster (`SelfVehicleController.PostStateCommand`), so the mod posts
    `VehicleProtocolManager.VehicleTransform` itself, with the live yaw and the real horizontal speed
    (remote clients interpolate at that speed). Vehicle drive speed stays capped at
    `MovementAntiCheating.SpeedThresholdOnVehicle` (9).
  - *on foot*: nothing parks the game's poster, so the mod drives the game's **own** conditional
    sender (`BasePlayerComponent.TrySendSelfTransform(false)`) — it posts only on a real change, so
    there are no duplicate packets when the player tick already sent this frame, plus one forced post
    on release. Note the server's on-foot threshold is `SpeedThresholdWalk` (**4.3**), below the
    noclip speed slider's minimum (5).
  - Off = the mod posts nothing while noclip drives.

### Disable OOB Teleport

- Suppresses the game's out-of-bounds rescue: the client checks the local player's position every
  frame against the current scene's `GameSceneConfig.detectMin/detectMax` box and teleports you to a
  safe point when you leave it (e.g. SeaWorld is capped at `y = 0`, so surfacing in the open sea
  yanks you back). Detection *and* teleport are entirely client-side — the server never corrects the
  local player's position.
- Two Mono `NativeDetour`s on `PlayerFishingShipComponent` (`TryBackToShip` → true = short-circuit,
  `LeaveShipThenTeleportToSafePos` → no-op), installed lazily behind the world-ready gate; with the
  toggle off both forward to the originals, so vanilla behaviour is byte-exact.
- The Settings → "reset position" button is unaffected (different entry point).
- Persisted; default off. Source: `buddy/OutOfBoundsGuardFeature.cs`.

### Instant Teleport

- Skips the game's animated transfer for in-game teleports (teleport points, dialogue, quests, UGC):
  no `SwitchScenePanel` splash, no fixed 2 s + 1 s waits (`LevelScriptableConfig
  .TransferAnimationLimitTime` / `TransferLoadingLimitTime`), and no uninterruptible
  `PlayerSwitchSceneOn` action — that action is configured `InterruptFlags.Null`, which is what
  freezes movement for ~3 s in vanilla.
- One Mono `NativeDetour` on `TransferCommand.IsExecutable` returning `-1`
  (`InteractErrorCode.Invalid`). `EventCommand<T>.ExecuteAsync` then skips `OnExecuteAsync`
  entirely through the game's own path, and `PlayerInteraction.ToastInteractError` explicitly
  ignores `Invalid`, so the refusal is silent. The warp itself is driven from a
  the **command argument itself** — the `in TransferCommandEvent` pointer the detour receives
  (`switchSceneType` / `targetPos` / `angle`, offsets resolved at runtime from the struct metadata)
  — through the mod's normal `TeleportToLocation` path, which also redirects to the vehicle when
  driving. The argument is the only source that covers every producer: the command is built from
  `PlayerTeleportation`, from `CommonTeleportation` (the ordinary teleport-point round trip), from
  `PlayerFieldTeleportation`, and from two places with no event at all.
- Only `SwitchSceneType.Story` transfers with a validated target are refused; everything else
  forwards to the original, so the Settings → "reset position" button and the fishing-ship
  out-of-bounds rescue keep their vanilla behaviour.
- **Courier-station handshake.** The map's fast-travel points are courier stations, and that ride is
  the one teleport with server-side state: `StartTransferToCourierStationCommand` → the server adds
  the persisted, synced `TransferringToCourierStationComponent` → the transfer's `action` callback
  sends `EndTransferToCourierStationCommand` once it has verified the player is within 1 m of the
  target. Refusing the command swallows that callback, so the feature **sends the End itself** right
  after the warp (the 1 m check holds by construction — it warps onto the target). Without it the
  player would stay flagged "transferring" permanently and be dragged back to the station on every
  login. `EndTransferToCourierStation` is resolved at install time; if it is missing the feature
  refuses to arm rather than risk leaving that state open.
- **Cross-level teleports are untouched by construction**: `TeleportModule.PlayerTeleportation`
  routes those to `TransferToRoom` → `LoginSystem.TeleportToRoomLevel`, which never goes through
  `TransferCommand`. Room/world transfers keep their normal loading screen.
- **Wait For Field Load** (second toggle, default on): after the warp, hold the player on the
  target until `EntityUtil.IsFieldLoaded(inFieldOwnerId)` reports the destination field streamed in
  (bounded at 6 s, re-assert every 0.15 s), then release. This is vanilla's `WaitUntilRendered`
  protection against dropping through unloaded terrain, minus the fixed wait — normally a fraction
  of a second. Off = single warp, free to move immediately. If the probe can't be resolved on the
  build, it falls back to a 0.6 s blind hold.
- Skipped side effects of the vanilla command: it also closed the fullscreen panel the teleport was
  triggered from (the map may stay open) and exited the current player state first (we warp as-is,
  like every other mod teleport).
- Persisted; default off. Source: `buddy/InstantTeleportFeature.cs`.

### Skip Craft / Dye Animations

- Cuts the character animation that plays after the server confirms a craft or a dye, so the
  workbench loop stops costing several seconds per item.
- Crafting and dyeing are **one path**: `CraftCompositeDetailPanel` (craft), `DyeColorPanel` (dye)
  and `DrawSewingPanel` (artwork overlay) all dispatch `MakeItemEvent` → `MakeItemCommand`, which
  hides the scene UI, sends the command and waits on `RPCRespTask<MakeItemResultEvent>`; on the
  response it casts `PlayerCraftsmanArg` → `PlayerCraftsmanAction` (animator trigger `Craftsman`,
  or `Dye` when `staticId == 0`, in the `interactivecraftsman` controller, 10 s `timeOut`).
- Lever: **`ActorActionGraph.EndCasting()`** — the exact call the game itself makes when a cast
  finishes naturally (`AbilityCaster.TickGraph` calls it the moment the sequence track reports
  done) and when one action interrupts another. It runs `_sequenceTrack.Finish()` →
  `ClipWrapper.SetState(Done)` → `clip.Finish()` → `OnBehaveFinish`, i.e. the identical termination
  the natural path takes. Deliberately **not** `ActorActionGraph.Stop()`, which also tears down the
  motion graph — that shape broke fishing once.
- Everything that matters survives the cut because it lives in
  `PlayerCraftsmanAction.OnBehaveFinish`: `CancelOccupyCommand()` (releases the bench), the
  `SceneUIVisibilityRequestedEvent{visible=true}` that restores the HUD, and the reward toast /
  flaunt. The item itself is granted server-side before the animation, so nothing is lost.
- Safety gate: it fires **only** once `animationComponent.IsAnimState(Craftsman | Dye)` is true —
  the very condition `PlayerCraftsmanAction.OnBehaveTick` waits on. Those triggers are set in
  `OnBehaveStart`, so seeing the state proves the clip reached its Action phase (the only phase in
  which `ActorBehaveClip.OnDestroy` runs `OnBehaveFinish`) and that the walk-to-bench before-action
  is over. Cutting earlier would strand the player occupying the bench with a hidden HUD.
- Second belt on that one destructive call: `ActorActionGraph.actionContext` must be the
  `PlayerCraftsmanArg` (`AbilityCaster._context` is set once per cast), so `EndCasting()` is
  provably scoped to the craft/dye cast.
- Trigger is event-first: `MakeItemResultEvent` (payload snapshotted for logging only) opens a 6 s
  poll window at 20 Hz; until that detour installs a 3.3 Hz fallback poll keeps the feature working
  (`IsGameEventHookInstalled` pattern). All game access is public API over AuraMono — no native
  detour, no IL2CPP `.text` patch. Local player only; other players' craft animations are untouched.
- **The walk to the bench is left alone.** `PlayerCraftsmanArg` implements `IMoveStrideWhenStart`,
  so `PlayerActionGraph.GetBeforeActions` expands the cast into `Generic_MoveStride` →
  `Generic_FaceDirectionAction` → `PlayerCraftsmanAction`, and the trip cannot be cancelled anyway:
  `Generic_MoveStride.OnBehaveFinish` does `WorldPlaceTo(_destination)` unconditionally, so the
  player lands at the bench however the clip ends. For plain crafting, Direct Craft Send below
  removes the whole sequence — walk included. Dye still walks; that is vanilla.
- Persisted; default off. Source: `buddy/CraftAnimationSkipFeature.cs`.

### Direct Craft Send

- The alternative to the above for plain crafting: the Craft button sends the network command and
  that is all — no occupancy, no walk, no animation, because `PlayerCraftsmanArg` is only ever cast
  from `MakeItemCommand`'s RPC callback, which never runs.
- Nothing has to close the UI: `CraftCompositeDetailPanel._Make()` already does
  `CloseView(this)` + `CloseView<CraftCompositeMainPanel>()` **before** it submits.
- Same lever as **Instant Teleport**: a Mono `NativeDetour` on `MakeItemCommand.IsExecutable`
  returning `-1` (`InteractErrorCode.Invalid`). `ButtonCommand<T>.ExecuteAsync` then skips
  `OnExecuteAsync` through the game's own path, and `PlayerInteraction.ToastInteractError` ignores
  `Invalid`, so the refusal is silent. The payload is read from the `in MakeItemEvent` pointer the
  detour receives — the one place all three producers funnel through — with offsets **resolved at
  runtime from the struct's metadata** (`mono_field_get_offset` minus the 2-pointer boxed header)
  and sanity-checked. That matters here: `MakeItemEvent` mixes scalars with a `List<>` reference, so
  its layout is not safely guessable.
- The send is `WebRequestUtility.SendCommand<MakeItemNetworkCommand>` on the next main-thread tick
  (the detour body stays callback-free: scalar reads, static writes, constant return or trampoline).
  Built directly rather than via `CraftProtocolManager.MakeItem`, whose `int? themeId` would mean a
  `Nullable<>` argument over `mono_runtime_invoke`.
- **Plain crafts only.** Dye and artwork overlay forward to the original — their payload lives in
  the `List<(int, Color32)> colors` reference field, which cannot be reconstructed from a native
  callback without holding a mono object pointer across frames. They keep the vanilla sequence and
  are covered by Skip Craft / Dye Animations instead.
- **Occupy release (required, not optional).** The vanilla craft always ends with
  `CharacterProtocolManager.CancelOccupyCommand()` — from `PlayerCraftsmanAction.OnBehaveFinish` on
  success and from the `RPCRespTask` timeout callback on failure. Refusing the command skips both,
  and the bench stays flagged occupied; `LocalPlayerComponent.EnabledInteraction` bails early on
  `levelObject.isOccupied`, so the bench's interact icon never comes back (the bug this feature
  shipped with on 2026-08-03). The mod therefore owes the server that release and sends
  `ItemReleaseNetworkCommand { ReleaseItemNetId = 0, CharacterPartMask = Body }` itself — byte-for-
  byte what `CancelOccupyCommand()` sends with its defaults — on the `MakeItemResultEvent`, or after
  a 1.5 s fallback if no result arrives (just past vanilla's 1 s `RPCRespTask` timeout, so both
  vanilla branches are covered). A pending release is flushed even if the toggle is switched off in
  the meantime.
- Vanilla checks not replicated (they need game-Mono calls, forbidden inside the callback): missing
  focus object, bench owner in build mode, and player not in free locomotion. So crafting works
  while seated, where vanilla refuses with tip 92001. The server still validates recipe/materials.
  No reward toast either — that comes from `OnBehaveFinish`, which never runs; the item still
  arrives and the bag refresh fires.
- ⚠ A **new** native detour, the project's highest-risk category. Opt-in, default off, and the
  detour is `Undo()`n the moment the toggle goes off, so leaving it alone adds no surface.
- Persisted; default off. Source: `buddy/CraftDirectSendFeature.cs`.

### Ignore Interaction-Area Obstacles

- Removes the client refusal **"Obstacles in the interaction area!"** (`InteractErrorCode
  .InteractAreaUnSafe` = 91525 — the error code *is* the localization id of the toast, dispatched as
  `UITipEvent{ tipId }` and rendered by `UIEventBridge` → `TipDecorator.Toast`).
- What the game is testing: prefabs may carry help points named `interact_collision_safe` ..
  `interact_collision_safe5` (`LevelObjectHelpPointName`) marking where the character will stand.
  `ActorMovementComponent.CheckAreaCollisionSafe` requires ground under that spot
  (`CheckHasWalkableBelow`, SphereCast 500 m down) **and** an empty player-sized capsule at it
  (`LevelLayerManager.CheckPlayerCollisionSafe`, `OverlapCapsule` on `playerCollisionLayer`, radius
  `InteractSystem.InteractCollisionSafeRadius` = 0.3 m by default from
  `LevelScriptableConfig.interactionConfigPC`). Colliders belonging to the interaction target itself
  are excluded (`levelObject.IsOwnerHandleCollision`); anything else — a chair pushed against the
  stove, a UGC prop, a pet — blocks the interaction.
- Three producers return 91525, and the first two both fire on a single click, so all three are
  hooked: `LocalPlayerComponent.CanExecuteInteraction` (the generic gate, run before **any**
  `HasTargetCommand`; vanilla skips it only for CommandId 21 = Repair),
  `InteractWithCookerCommand.IsExecutable` (pots and stoves) and
  `PressurePadTriggerCommand.IsExecutable` (UGC springboards).
- Lever: one Mono `NativeDetour` per producer that **calls the original through its trampoline** and
  rewrites only the `91525` answer to `0`. Deliberately not a constant hook —
  `CanExecuteInteraction` is also where stamina, bag-full, invalid-target and build-in-building are
  decided, and a blanket `0` would silently disable all of them. Every other refusal, and every
  other toast, is untouched.
- Client-side only: the interaction still travels the game's own command path and the server still
  validates it. This cannot conjure an interaction the server would refuse — it stops the client
  refusing one before it is ever sent.
- The detours install behind the world-ready gate the first time the toggle is on and are never torn
  down (`native-detours-world-change-corruption`); switching the toggle off makes every body forward
  to the original, i.e. byte-exact vanilla. A missing target after a game update disarms that one
  hook with a log line and leaves the others working.
- **Second toggle — Ignore build mode on the interaction target** (separate, also default off).
  Removes **"Target being adjusted. Unable to interact now."** =
  `InteractErrorCode.TargetInBuilding` (10144), whose only producer in the whole client is the same
  `CanExecuteInteraction`, ten lines below the obstacle test: it takes the target's parent
  `FieldComponent` and asks `EntityUtil.IsBuildInBuilding` — true when the plot owner has
  `PlayerBuildModeData.BuildMode` set, or the private home has `PrivateHomeComponentData.buildMode`.
  So the refusal means "somebody is editing the plot this object sits in", which is a different
  question from "the way is blocked" and gets its own switch: while a plot really is being edited the
  furniture can move or vanish server-side, so this is the likelier of the two to be refused again on
  the server. No extra detour — the gate is already hooked; only one more code is rewritten, and the
  toggle arms it independently. `IsBuildInBuilding` also clears a stale build-mode flag of your own
  (`CharacterProtocolManager.PostBuildMode(false, 4)`) — the original still runs through the
  trampoline, so that self-heal is kept.
- Live status shows how many blocks were cleared this session; `[InteractObstacle]` verbose logging
  is a Settings → Logging row.
- Persisted; default off. Source: `buddy/InteractObstacleBypassFeature.cs`.

### Auto-learn Recipes

- Learns every blueprint / cookbook / music sheet that lands in the backpack — no Learn animation,
  no batch-confirm panel, no click.
- **Trigger:** `QuickLearnEvent`. The game's own `QuickLearnSystem` listens to
  `DataCreated<BackpackItem>` and dispatches it 0.5 s after a learnable item arrives (the same
  signal that raises the vanilla quick-learn prompt), so the feature is event-driven with a 10 s
  poll fallback until the detour installs. The payload's `List<uint>` is never read — the dispatch
  alone is the signal and the netIds are re-derived from the bag.
- **Action:** `CharacterProtocolManager.LearnRecipes(List<uint>)` over AuraMono, i.e.
  `LearnMoreRecipeNetworkCommand`. This is the same call the game itself makes in
  `BackpackLearnRecipe`'s animation-free branch (taken when a full-screen UI is open or the player
  is busy), which is why nothing has to cancel a cast: there is no cast. Batches are chunked to the
  command's `[MaxLength(120)]`.
- **Selection is a strict allowlist** of `EntityType` blueprint (302), cookbook (47) and music sheet
  (42) — exactly `BackPackSystem.GetAllRecipe()`'s predicate. `QuickLearnSystem`'s own cache also
  queues choosable treasure chests, which are not recipes and must never reach the command;
  `homelandblueprint` (228) is likewise excluded, so house blueprints are never consumed.
- Each item netId is attempted at most twice per world load (ledger cleared on world-ready), so a
  recipe the server refuses cannot loop.
- ⚠ Learning **consumes** the item. Recipes you meant to gift, sell or keep will be used up while
  this is on. Also note that with AutoSell running as well, the two features race for the same bag
  contents — whichever sweeps first wins.
- Persisted; default off. Self → Main. Source: `buddy/AutoLearnRecipeFeature.cs`.

### Auto-like Own Home

- Sends the one daily "very nice" reaction to your own mailbox, without walking to it — the same
  thing a click on the like bar over the mailbox does. Received likes feed
  `HouseLikeBpComponent.LikeCount` and thus `StateEnum.HouseLikeLevel`, whose 20 / 50 / 100
  thresholds (`BpLikeLevel`) unlock the seasonal mailbox pendants and emissions.
- **Action:** `EmojiFeedBackProtocolManager.SendFeedBack(ownerNetId, [999], [])` over AuraMono, i.e.
  `EmojiFeedBackCommand`. Expression 999 is hardcoded because it is the only row in the design
  tables whose `emojiFeedBackTypes` contains `EmojiFeedBackType.Home` — which is also why the
  vanilla click never opens the reaction picker (`ShouldQuickSubmit` skips it at one available
  expression). The target is the home owner's **player** netId, so for your own home it is simply
  your own — no entity scan, no proximity, no mailbox.
- **State:** the same pair the mailbox widget draws its `alreadyLiked` from —
  `EmojiReactionPanelLogic.GetHomeTodayFeedbackGuid(selfNetId)` then `IsEmojiFeedbackLiked(guid)`.
  Nothing is sent while it reports liked. ⚠ `HouseLikeProtocolManager.GetSelfHouseLikeData()` looks
  like the natural answer and is **not**: measured live, neither its `IsGaveLike` nor its `Today`
  moves for an EmojiFeedBack like (`today 0, total 4` across a clean send).
- **Where it fires:** an empty today-feedback guid means your home's feedback entity is not streamed
  to the client here — the state in which the mailbox widget could not show a like bar either — so
  nothing is sent and the feature waits. In practice that makes it fire in your homeland. netIds are
  room-scoped, so a command naming your player netId from the wrong room is at best a no-op.
- **Trigger:** `EmojiFeedBackRecordUpdateEvent`, dispatched whenever your own feedback records
  change, so confirmation is immediate and the daily rotation of the today-entity is noticed inside
  a running session; a timer re-check backs it up (30 s while waiting, 15 min once done). The hook
  is registered only once the toggle is on.
- At most two sends between confirmations. If the like does not show up in your own records
  afterwards, the feature says so in the log and stops instead of re-sending.
- ⚠ Sends a real command to a live server on its own schedule, unattended.
- Persisted; default off. Self → Main. Source: `buddy/HomeLikeFeature.cs`.

### Anti-AFK

- Periodically simulates mouse input to reduce idle kick.
- Configurable interval (5–120 seconds).

### Building — Bypass Overlap

- Client-side building placement overlap bypass.
- Applies additional Harmony patch on demand (`EnsureBypassPatched`).
- Credits third-party contributor in UI.

### Chat Translate Unlock

- Unlocks chat translation for messages the game refuses to translate: the game tags every
  message with the **sender's UI language** (`ChatMessageComponent.LangCode`, reported once via
  `ConnectScene_CS`), not the language of the text — so a player typing e.g. Russian on an
  English UI produces messages an English-UI receiver gets no Translate button for.
- Hooks the `ReceiveChatMessage` EventCenter event (scalar fields only) and for non-self
  messages whose langKey **equals** ours sends `ChatProtocolManager.RequestTranslateStream(msgId,
  originalText)` directly (AuraMono static invoke), skipping the client-side langKey gate. The
  text is resolved by msgId from `ChatSystem.record` — the stream endpoint rejects an empty
  `OriginalMessage` with 4207. Foreign-langKey messages stay with the game's own translate
  pipeline (its in-panel Translate toggle) — never double-requested, because duplicate stream
  chunks would corrupt the game's append-only translation cache.
- The langKey gate is **client-side only**: the server translates by detecting the language of the
  supplied text, so these messages do get translated once the request goes out (verified live).
- Results ride the game's own stream pipeline (`RequestTranslateStreamResultEvent` →
  `ChatSystem` cache → `TranslateResultUIEvent`), so bubbles/HUD/history update natively.
- Requires the overseas game build (translation service); server weekly char limits still apply.
  Toggle persisted in config (`chatForceTranslateEnabled`). Implementation:
  `ChatForceTranslateFeature.cs`.
- Sub-toggles:
  - **Debug Log** (`chatTranslateVerboseLog`) — per-message decision trace (sender langKey vs
    yours, message text, and every server stream result incl. game-initiated) to the mod log.
    On completion logs the finished translation (`orig -> translated`), not just errors.
  - **Force ALL Languages** (`chatTranslateForceAllLangs`) — also request foreign-langKey messages,
    but only when the in-game Translate toggle is off (never double-request the game's own path).
  Note: the Debug Log toggle is **session-only** — it is never saved to config, so it always starts
  off (it prints a line per chat message).

### Party & Events Auto-Decline (Self → Privacy sub-tab)

**Four** toggles, in two independent pairs — because the game has two parallel "join other players"
systems that look the same in the UI and share no code:

| Pair | Covers | Table | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Party** | the 5 minigame party types: Free, Sea Fishing, Tea, Obstacle, Hide-and-Seek | `Party` (5 rows) | `PartyAutoDeclineFeature.cs` |
| **Events** | every scheduled world event — all the fish-shoal events (Neritic Shoal Event = id 225/226), toy-fish, ice-crystal fish… | `ActivityEvent` (~606 rows) | `ActivityEventAutoDeclineFeature.cs` |

**The daily events that auto-join you in an area are the Events pair, not the Party pair.** A party
toggle will not touch a shoal event and vice versa; if a toggle appears to do nothing, first check
which subsystem the thing you are testing against actually belongs to.

The Events pair mirrors the Party pair exactly: `ActivityInvitedEvent` /
`OtherRoomActivityInvitedEvent` suppressed for invites, `SelfActivityChangedEvent` +
`ActivityEventSystem.IsSelfInActivity()` as the membership trigger,
`ActivityEventProtocolManager.SendQuitActivityEventCommand()` to leave, and
`OnRequestJoinActivitySuccess` (plus an invite deliberately let through, plus `IsSelfVisitor()`) as
the deliberate-join discriminators. Persisted as `activityAutoDeclineInvites` /
`activityAutoLeaveEvents`, both default off. Verbose tracing: `MasterLogActivityAutoDecline`.

One known gap on the Events side: activities *do* have a real reject command
(`SendRejectActivityEventCommand`, `ActivityOpType.Reject = 3`) that the game sends on hang-up, but
it needs the inviter's **short** id while the event carries only net ids — and the conversion
(`TryGetPlayerShortId(uint, out long)`) is a value-type out-param through `mono_runtime_invoke`, the
documented stack-corruption trap. So invites are suppressed rather than rejected: the inviter sees a
timeout instead of an immediate decline.

The Party pair below (`partyAutoDeclineInvites` / `partyAutoLeaveParties`, both default off). Kept
separate on purpose: the first is side-effect free, the second talks to the server.

- **Auto-Decline Party Invites** — an invite is not a dialog, it is a **phone call**
  (`PartyInvitedEvent` → `PartyModule.NoticeInvited` → `PhoneModule.AddCall` → 30 s ringing
  overlay → missed-call entry + red point). The toggle suppresses the `PartyInvitedEvent` /
  `OtherRoomPartyInvitedEvent` dispatch, so no call is ever built: no ring, no overlay, no missed
  call. **Nothing is sent to the server** — the game has no "reject party invite" command at all
  (`PhoneModule.DropCall` only emits a reject for activity and joint-building calls, the party
  branch is empty), so a suppressed invite looks exactly like a missed call.
  - Trade-off: the same handler feeds `_canJoinPartyIds`, which gates
    `PartyModule.CanJoinToPrivateParty`. While this is on, a **private** party you were invited to
    cannot be joined by hand — the invite never reaches the client. Open parties and the party
    festival are unaffected.
- **Auto-Leave Parties Joined By Area** — walking into a party's home area joins you to it, and
  that is **100% server-side**: the client's 500 ms area tick
  (`PartyClientService.CheckPlayerPartyArea`) only raises local enter/leave events and sends no
  join, so there is nothing to refuse — the only possible answer is to leave afterwards. The
  toggle watches `PartyMembershipChangedEvent` and calls `PartyProtocolManager.LeaveParty()`, the
  exact static behind the in-game Exit button, which is why it inherits the server's "left
  deliberately → do not re-add me when I walk back in" behaviour.
  - **Your own joins are left alone.** Two signals mark a membership as deliberate:
    `ApplyPartyGameResultEvent{Success}` (only ever produced by a join *we* requested; an area
    auto-add arrives as `JoinPartyTipsEvent` instead) and `PartySystem.IsSelfVisitor()` (visitor
    status in another town is only reachable by clicking Join on a cross-town party).
  - Attempts are capped — 3 s apart, at most 3 per 60 s — after which the feature stops and toasts
    *"leave the party area on foot"*. In normal operation exactly one leave is ever sent; the cap
    only exists for edge cases (party recreated with a fresh netId, re-invite, server restart) and
    for a server that refuses the leave outright (`PartyErrorCode.NotAllowLeaveParty`, e.g. during
    hide & seek).
- The Privacy sub-tab shows a live counter (`Invites declined: N | parties left: M`) and the
  feature's status line. Verbose tracing: `MasterLogPartyAutoDecline`.

### Auto-Claim Event Rewards (Self)

Drains the rewards of a player-hosted **ActivityEvent** the moment it ends, so the "Claim Rewards"
button on `PartyMembersPanel` never has to be pressed. Implementation:
`ActivityRewardAutoClaimFeature.cs`, persisted as `activityRewardAutoClaim`. The toggle sits on the
main Self tab, not under Privacy — it claims rewards rather than refusing contact.

- **The button does not claim.** `PartyMembersPanel.ClaimReward` only opens `EventRewardPanel`; the
  claim is two independent static sends in that panel —
  `ActivityEventProtocolManager.SendGetActivityEventRewardCommand(Personal|Team, info.NetId)`. The
  feature calls the **manager**, never building `GetActivityRewardCommand` itself: its `RewardType`
  is an enum field and `TrySetObjectMember` cannot set enums without `Enum.ToObject`.
- **Gates mirrored from the panel:** `ActivityEventSystem.CanGetReward(idArg, netId, type)` — the
  same call that drives the button's interactability — where `idArg` is
  `GetPersonalGoalId(staticId)` for Personal (a `0` result means the event has no personal goal, so
  that half is skipped for good) and `staticId` itself for Team; plus `CheckRewardClaimed(netId,
  type)`, the local dictionary the game's own panel writes, which stops a second send after a manual
  claim. `CanGetReward` is backed by a server-pushed component and can turn true *after* the end, so
  the job polls every 2 s for up to 120 s instead of firing once.
- **Trigger costs zero hook slots.** `SelfActivityChangedEvent` is already hooked by the auto-decline
  half at `payloadBytes` 0; re-registering appends a second handler to the same entry and grows the
  payload to 64 for both. `hasValue` of its `ActivityEventInfo?` is the end discriminator — every
  join/start/update dispatch is `default(...)`, while both end paths (organizer via
  `ActivityEndEvent`, participant via `QuitActivityEvent{ActivityFinish}`) converge on
  `OnEndActivity` and set it. Jobs dedupe by netId because both can fire for one end.
- **Offsets** (bare, i.e. boxed minus 16): `hasValue`@0, `NetId`@8, `StaticId`@12, `StatusType`@32 —
  `ActivityEventInfo` keeps declaration order and `Nullable<T>` on this build is corefx-ordered
  (`hasValue` first), both measured live.
- **Why the event payload and not the list.** `GetAllActivityEventInfo()` is a safe reference-returning
  call, but it is useless at end time: the end is raised with `needWithDestroy: true`, so the entity
  may already carry `NetworkEntityDestroyedTag` while the list defaults to filtering those out. The
  list is used only for the world-ready sweep (an event still sitting in `Ending` after a relog),
  filtered by `StatusType == Ending` and `CheckPlayerInActivity(netId, selfNetId)`.
- **Failures are silent.** `ActivityRewardRefreshEvent` is dispatched only on
  `ActivityErrorCode.Success`; a rejection goes to `ShowErrorToast` and never reaches the mod. A
  claim is therefore judged by the *absence* of an ack: no ack in 10 s → one retry → give up with a
  `FeatureLog.Fail` naming netId/staticId. An event that simply ended with an unmet goal logs at
  `Once`, not `Fail` — that is the normal outcome of a lost team target.
- One command per 2 s tick, so the two claims of an event never leave in the same frame.
- **Separate toggle: "Hide the event results panel"** (`activityHideEndPanel`).
  `ActivityEventEndingNoticeRequestedEvent` has exactly one listener
  (`UIEventBridge.OnActivityEventEndingNoticeRequested`) whose body only opens
  `PartySoonPanel(Finish)` and, when the event's `isOpenResult` is set, wires the callback that
  opens `PartyMembersPanel`. Suppressing the dispatch removes both and nothing else. Deliberately
  NOT tied to auto-claim: that panel is also the only manual claim route, so hiding it is the
  player's call rather than a side effect of automation.
- **The trigger reads BOTH candidate `Nullable<T>` layouts.** `ActivityEventInfo` itself was
  measured, but the wrapper was not — the offsets came from describing the open generic and
  inferring the closed instantiation, and the first live run produced no trigger line at all while
  the game's end panel opened normally. corefx order (`hasValue` first → NetId@8/StaticId@12) and
  Mono order (`value` first → NetId@0/StaticId@4, `has_value` past the 64-byte snapshot) are both
  read and both offered as jobs; a misread pair is harmless because nothing is sent until
  `CanGetReward` accepts that netId, which it never will for garbage. The first 12 dispatches dump
  their leading bytes at `FeatureLog.Life` so the layout gets settled from evidence.
- ⚠️ **Not yet witnessed at a real event end** — the layout was measured while nothing was ending, so
  the dispatch order and the `StatusType` value at that instant are read off the decompiled code.
  The trigger therefore logs every end it sees at `FeatureLog.Life` unconditionally: the first real
  end is meant to confirm `hasValue=1` with a sane netId/staticId before the automation is trusted.

### Custom Jump (Self → Fun sub-tab)

- Four numeric input fields that retune the player's jump arc by writing the game's live
  `MotionConfig` (`LevelScriptableConfig.Instance.playerMotion`) — the object every jump/gravity
  constant is read through, every frame, with no caching:
  - **Jump Height, hold (m)** → `JumpingHighest` (default 1.3)
  - **Jump Height, tap (m)** → converted to `JumpingInitSpeed` via `v = √(2·|G|·h)` (default 0.72 m
    = the stock 4.8 m/s launch)
  - **Gravity (m/s²)** → `Gravity`, stored positive and negated on write (default 16)
  - **Fall Speed Limit (m/s)** → `FallingSpeedLimit`, likewise (default 13)
- **The two heights are separate on purpose.** While Space is held the game solves a dynamic
  gravity so the apex lands exactly on `JumpingHighest` (`StandLocomotion.cs:406-443`), which means
  raising the launch speed alone does nothing for a held jump — "hold" is the number that raises it.
  A tap never reaches the solver, so it is governed by launch speed vs gravity instead.
- **Reset to Defaults** button restores the values the *live game* had (captured off the config
  object before the first write), falling back to the stock constants if the feature has not applied
  yet this session. It rewrites the four inputs only — the toggle is left as-is, since Custom Jump
  on + default values is the same arc as off.
- **Fully client-side**: no signal, no packet, no dirty-mask status. (The trampoline's
  `moveComponent.SetMoveSpeed` route would have gone out over `SendSyncStatus`; this one does not.)
- Heights clamp to 0.2–8 m, gravity to 2–60, fall limit to 3–80. The upper bounds are a
  fall-through guard, not taste: `XDCharacterController` sweeps once per frame, so a much faster
  launch starts tunnelling through floors and stair colliders.
- Originals are captured from the live object before the first write and restored when the toggle
  goes off; values re-apply on a 0.5 s throttle so a config reload cannot silently revert them, and
  nothing is attempted outside a loaded world (`IsGameDataQueryable`).
- Caveat: the constants are **global**, so remote players' jumps look altered on your client too,
  and skating / holding-hands locomotion read the same values. Cosmetic only.
- Toggle + the four values persist in config (`jumpTuningEnabled`, `jumpTuningHoldHeight`,
  `jumpTuningTapHeight`, `jumpTuningGravity`, `jumpTuningFallSpeedLimit`). Implementation:
  `JumpTuningFeature.cs`.

### Quiet congratulation popups (Self)

Swallows the family of full-screen "well done" cards the game throws up after a collection
milestone, at the event level — the panel is never built.

| Channel | Event | Panel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Справочник → сертификация коллекционера | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events.PictorialProgressRewardEvent` | `PictorialProgressRewardPanel` |
| Ранг коллекционера | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events.CertificationLevelUpEvent` | `PictorialCollectLevelUpTipPanel` |
| Достижения | `XDTGameSystem.UI.AchievementUnlockedNotifyEvent` | `AchievementTipPanel` |
| Уровень хобби | `XDTGameSystem.UI.HobbyUnlockedEvent` | `HobbyUnlockPanel` |
| «Новая запись в справочнике» | `XDTGame.UI.PictorialTipShowRequestedEvent` | `PictorialTipPanel` |
| BattlePass collect tip | `XDTGameSystem.UI.BattlePassCollectTipEvent` | `BattlePassCollectTipPanel` |

- Each of these events has exactly **one** listener in the whole game (`UIEventBridge`) and each of
  those handlers does nothing but `SomePanel.Open(...)`. Rewards are already granted server-side
  before the dispatch (`MailSyncSystem` raises them off a `RewardNotice`), and every panel on the
  receiving end is display-only — none sends a protocol, marks anything read, or writes PlayerPrefs.
  Suppressing the forward therefore removes the visual and nothing else.
- Same mechanism as Skip Show Off's `AlertRewardsEvent`: a suppress-forward hook on the EventCenter
  dispatch detour. No `.text` patches.
- **Hooks register lazily**, only the first time the toggle goes on — slots are never released and
  the pool is shared with every other feature, so an unused filter costs nothing. A refused hook is
  logged at Warning naming the channel, because the visible symptom would otherwise read as
  "the toggle does nothing".
- Not covered: the "Obtained" reward modal (`AlertRewardPanel`) — that one lives under **Skip Show
  Off**. Persisted as `quietCongratsPopups`. Implementation: `QuietPopupsFeature.cs`.

**Separate toggle: "Hide the Battle Pass reward popup"** (`quietBpPayRewardPopup`).
`AlertBPPayRewardPanel` — the granted battle-pass rewards *plus* a "buy the paid pass" upsell
(`payRewardBg` / `toBuy@btn` / `payRewards@list`) — so it is not a pure congratulation card and gets
its own switch and its own hook latch. Chain: `MailSyncSystem` (`WorldSystem.ShowBattlePassPayReward`)
→ `ShowBpPayRewardEvent` → `DefaultModule.ShowBpPayRewardEventHandler` (pure field copy) →
**`XDTGameSystem.UI.AlertBPPayRewardEvent`** → `UIEventBridge.OnAlertBPPayReward` →
`AlertBPPayRewardPanel.Open`. Hooked at the lower, terminal channel for the same reason
`AlertRewardsEvent` is preferred over `AlertRewardEvent`. payloadBytes 0.

### Game UI — Custom UI Timings (Self → Game UI sub-tab)

- Editable display durations for the game's tip/toast popups: item-obtained bubbles
  (`LightToastPanel`, game default 2.5 s), text toasts, buff icon toasts, and the four
  `HarvestTipPanel` banners (pictorial / achievement / cat-buff / task).
- Overrides float fields of the live `TipShowTimeConfig` (`ConfigManager.TipConfig.TipShowTimeConfig`)
  via AuraMono `mono_field_set_value`; re-applied on a 0.5 s throttle so config reloads can't revert it.
- Originals captured before the first write; disabling the toggle restores them.
- Sliders 0.5–15 s + "Reset to game defaults" button; persisted in config
  (`gameUiTimingsEnabled` / `gameUiTimingSeconds`). Implementation: `GameUiTimingsFeature.cs`.

### Game LOD — World Detail / Draw Distance (Self → Game LOD sub-tab)

Overrides the game's five client-side LOD/streaming systems so more world objects render, further
away, at higher quality. All controls default OFF, re-apply idempotently every ~2.5 s (world
reloads / mode switches recreate the managers), and revert to game defaults when switched off.
Implementation: `GameLodFeature.cs` + `HeartopiaComplete.UguiGameLodContent.cs`; research map in
memory `world-lod-streaming-map`.

| Section | Controls | Mechanism (all AuraMono; mirrors the game's own debug `ObserverPanel` where one exists) |
|---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Furniture & buildings | toggle + max objects (60–5000), draw distance (100–9999 m), mesh detail distance (100–2000 m) | `IRenderingSystem.LoaderManager.SetParam(max, loadNum, 20, strucLoadNum, dist[4], dist[4], meshDis)` via `Managers._serviceDic` walk + `LayerDistanceCulling.Instance.enabled=false` (the `ObserverPanel.SetHomeland` recipe); per-frame budgets scale with the cap (`max/500` clamped 3–10, `max/125` clamped 20–40) instead of the game's flat 3/frame, which meant ~28 s of pop-in at cap 5000; revert re-reads `RenderLoadConfig` getters (`RevertBuildLoader` recipe) and re-enables the culler |
| Mesh quality | LOD-bias boost toggle + slider ×1–×4 | `AreaPriorityManager.UpdateGlobalLodBias` — re-asserted because the low-FPS governor in SignificanceManager drops the bias to 0.2. **A "Force max mesh detail (BRG LOD0)" toggle was removed 2026-07-27**: `BrgManager.ForeceLOD0` is read in exactly one place in the game — native `_BrgRenderSystem._Add` — and when true it discards the per-instance override material array and rebuilds the batch from the shared prefab material. UGC textures live only on per-instance clones of that material, so the flag blanked every photo frame, jigsaw puzzle, drawing board and display shelf. Not fixable from the mod (the array is dropped inside IL2CPP native code) and redundant — LOD bias reaches the same visual goal via `lodDist / bias` without touching materials |
| Vegetation, rocks & islands | toggle + absolute detail value (10–1000, default 300) + "Also apply while the world loads" + "Rebake now" | writes PlayerPrefs `PC_LODBIAS` = **the slider value verbatim** — a QUALITY factor: `TreeLoad` computes `num = pref/10` and divides its baked thresholds by it, and those thresholds behave like `screenRelativeTransitionHeight` (bigger = swap sooner), so **higher pref = high-poly held further** (proven live: 30→3 made the swap closer, 30→300 gave the wanted distance). The game's own value is captured **once** at config load and **persisted** (`gameLodVegetationBaselinePref`) purely so the toggle can restore it; it is sanity-capped at 100, since anything higher is the mod's own output rather than a game setting. **Terrain and island chunks bake this value at chunk-load time**, so a post-load rebake (which only reaches instance blocks under `QualityLoader`) can never fix the chunks that loaded behind the splash screen — hence the explicit "Also apply while the world loads" checkbox: on = full terrain detail everywhere but slower loading, off (default) = fast loading with coarser chunks near spawn. Applied by rebaking `TreeLoad.SetAllDynamicInstanceBlockEnable(false→true)` + `HomeLoad.Inst` OnDisable/OnEnable (fails loudly when the scene has no `QualityLoader` root); re-asserted + auto-rebaked when the game's settings UI overwrites the key. **This is the lever for big baked scenery** (islands, cliffs, rocks): BRG geometry has no `Renderer` and no collider, so it never appears in physics or renderer scans |
| Landscape (HLOD + scene chunks) | toggle + distance multiplier ×1–×4 | **IL2CPP interop, not AuraMono**, two subsystems under one toggle: (a) `Unity.HLODSystem.Streaming.HLODController` public fields `hlod1/2LoadAndVisDistance`; (b) **`SceneLoader.SceneLoaderRoot.configs[]`** — the base-scene chunk streamer that owns rock/island low-poly→high-poly swaps: multiplies `loadDistance`/`unloadDistance` and every `hlodDistances[]` element (element writes hit the live array the LoadLayer holds). Both found via `FindObjectsOfType` + `FindObjectsOfTypeAll` fallback; originals per instance, restored on revert; applies live |
| Props (XDLod) | force-max-detail toggle | walk `XDLodManager.Instance.xdlodgroupmap.Keys` (AuraMono, pinned, budget 300 + rotation) → `XDLodGroupComponent.ForceLOD(0)`; only groups the mod forced (tracked by netId) are `ForceLOD(-1)`-reverted — game-forced NPC groups untouched; skips groups already forced by the game |
| Characters & NPCs | full-character-detail toggle | `SignificanceManager.Enable=false` (DataModule instance; exactly what photo mode does) — re-asserted because mode exits set it back |
| Live entities | toggle + range multiplier ×1–×5 | 3 s walk over `Entities.GetComponents<LevelEntityComponent>` (pinned), boosts registered nine-cell ranges via public `SetForceNineCell(short)`; originals remembered per netId and restored on revert. Capped by the server AOI — the server must have synced the entity |
| Shadows | toggle + distance 50–800 m | URP asset `shadowDistance` via `RenderingSettings.Instance.GetCurrentURPAsset()` (the `ObserverPanel.SetShadowDistance` path); original captured and restored |

Unity's own LODGroup bias/max-level stays in Settings → Main → Performance (`LodSettingsFeature.cs`);
its Custom bias cap was raised 4 → 16 (2026-07-25) because scenery LODGroups still swapped visibly at 4.

**Load-time behaviour:** the heavy sections (Furniture & buildings, Landscape, and the vegetation
rebake) are **deferred until the world settles**. The gate is the game's own post-warmup signal —
**`LoaderManager.IsRun`** (public static bool, read through AuraMono): `XDTwonScene_ShaderWarmup` sets
it `false` at scene init and `true` only once `ShaderWarmupControllerExport.GetLoadPercent() >= 1f`,
which is exactly when the game itself allows furniture streaming. On top of that we wait 8 s after a
local player position appears (45 s hard fallback); an unreadable flag counts as "not ready". Scene
changes reset the timer, drop stale per-instance baselines, and **clear any pending vegetation
rebake** — a freshly loaded scene already built its instance blocks from the current `PC_LODBIAS`
(`TreeLoad` reads it in `OnEnable`), so rebaking there is both redundant and expensive (it re-creates
every material and re-triggers shader-variant compilation mid-load). Reverts are never deferred.

**Verbose logging** is a normal session-only flag in **Settings → Logging → "Game LOD"** (off by
default). Turning it on re-arms the diagnostics: the dedup set and the "already reported" latches are
cleared, so the read-only resolve probe (every class/method/field this feature touches) and the
first-walk lines are reproduced on demand rather than swallowed as duplicates.

**Diagnostics** (`Dump nearby LOD objects to log` button): scene + live `lodBias`/`maxLODLevel`/`PC_LODBIAS`
(with the mod's baseline/target) + `QualityLoader` child count, every `SceneLoaderRoot` layer's live
distances, the FARTHEST Unity `LODGroup`s within 250 m, a renderer cone (>40 m, ≤12° off view centre)
and a camera raycast. Reading it: object listed with a `LODGroup` ⇒ `QualitySettings.lodBias` owns it;
listed without ⇒ streamed geometry; **not listed at all while facing big scenery ⇒ BRG/InstanceBlock
(no `Renderer`, no collider) ⇒ `PC_LODBIAS` owns it**.

## Resource Gathering

### Foraging (Teleport Farm)

Classic **radar-driven teleport farm**:

1. Requires **Radar enabled** with at least one loot category selected.
2. Teleports player to radar markers for mushrooms, berries, stones, etc.
3. Clicks interact / collects resources (including meteors via F-key auto-interact when **Aura Farm is off** and meteor radar category is active).
4. Configurable:
   - Area load delay after teleport
   - Resource click duration
   - Teleport cooldown between targets
   - Auto-repair pause during farm
   - Patrol point list (saved JSON)
   - Loot priority weights (fiddlehead, mustard, burdock, etc.)

Status strings: `IDLE`, `TELEPORTING...`, `GATHERING...`, etc.

#### Stealth Foraging

Optional companion toggle in **Foraging → SETTINGS** (persisted, default off, `StealthForagingFeature.cs`).
It only does anything **while the farm is actually running** — configuring it on an idle farm changes nothing.

While engaged:

- **Noclip is force-enabled** so the player holds position under the terrain instead of falling out of
  it (the hover drives the game's own `PlayerMoveComponent` every frame). The runtime flag only —
  noclip is not persisted, and a noclip the user already had on is left alone on stop.
- **The client-side OOB rescue is suppressed** for the duration of the run (it borrows the
  `OutOfBoundsGuardFeature` hooks through `IsOutOfBoundsGuardRequested()`; the persisted
  *Disable OOB Teleport* toggle in Self → Main is never written). The scene detect box has a floor
  as well as a ceiling (e.g. Star Town `y >= 9`), so under-terrain hops would otherwise be rescued
  mid-collect.
- **Resource hops land below the node:** every non-contamination resource **−1.5 m**.
  Contamination splits by anchor class (`TryGetContaminatedAnchorClass`, SeaCleanQteFeature.cs):
  **hosted −3 m** (permanent, stuck to a coral on the ground) vs **point-anchored +4 m**
  (temporary, spawned at a sub-area point and floating in open water — diving under one of those
  is what pushed the player back to the surface). Unknown class falls back to the hosted dive.
  **With Stealth Foraging off the node hop no longer adjusts Y at all** — contamination used to
  take a +7 m lift here; that lift now applies only to the cleansing-coral hop
  (`ApplyForagingNodeTeleportOffset`). **Area/zone arrivals dive too** (−1.5 m,
  `ApplyForagingAreaTeleportOffset`): the farm-location waypoints, the priority-area anchors and the
  startup routing hop. They used to keep their exact Y, which left the player standing in the open
  for the whole area-load + node-scan window — the most visible moment of a run. Streaming is
  position-driven, not Y-gated, so the lower arrival loads the same cells. The cleansing-coral hop
  still keeps its exact Y (it has to land on the coral to work).
- **Stopping surfaces first.** Every stop path — the Stop Foraging button, the auto-stop timer,
  Disable All, the friend-join stop, and the radar/aura guards — calls `SurfaceFromStealthForaging`
  **before** clearing `autoFarmActive`, warping back to the true `lastNodePosition`. Order is
  load-bearing: `StealthForagingActive` is gated on `autoFarmActive`, and the noclip restore rides
  the next frame, so gravity only returns once the player is already above ground.

The offset applies to the **teleport argument only**: `lastNodePosition` and every marker / cooldown /
dwell check keep the true node position, so radar matching and the collect confirmation are unchanged.
With the mode off, contamination keeps its vanilla sea-floor **lift** (`SeaCleanTeleportYOffset`, +7 m,
shared with the cleansing-coral hop).

#### Stealth Block

Two independent toggles in **Foraging → SETTINGS**, both persisted and default off.

**Hide from radar** (`StealthBlockFeature.cs`) mass-blocks the town so nobody can watch the run.
Blocking is *mutual* invisibility in this game — the server mirrors our block back to the target as
`BeBlockComponent`, so their client hides us too.

Like Stealth Foraging, the checkbox is a **setting, not the trigger**: blocking begins when
**Start Foraging** is pressed and every block it issued is released when the run ends — by the
button, the auto-stop timer, Disable All, or the friend-join stop. An idle farm blocks nobody.

It is a state machine, not a switch, and the farm **holds** until it reaches `Armed`:

| Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Arming` | walking the room roster, sending blocks, waiting for confirmation |
| `Armed` | no friend present **and** every stranger confirmed blocked — the farm may dive |
| `Blocked` | cannot arm: a friend is in town, the block list is full, or the game API did not resolve |

- **Confirmation is server state**, never "we sent the command": `BlockListProtocolManager.IsPlayerInBlockList(shortId)`.
- **Friends are excluded unconditionally.** Blocking a friend *deletes the friendship* server-side and
  unblocking does not restore it — the game's own dialog calls it "Delete and block". A friend in the
  room therefore holds the farm instead of being blocked. The friend test is fail-closed: if the game
  counts more friends in the room than the mod could identify, it assumes a friend is present.
- **Unblock on roster leave** (with a ~45 s grace period that absorbs town↔home bouncing), not on
  stream unspawn — the latter fires whenever anyone walks out of range and would storm the server.
  Keeping the list bounded matters: the town holds 12 (24 in Sea World) and the block list has a
  server cap (`ErrorCode.BlockMaxNum`).
- **The blocks we issued are persisted** (`stealthBlockOwnedShortIds`). That registry is the only
  record of which entries are ours vs the user's own manual blocks, so a crash mid-run can still be
  cleaned up: at the next world entry the registry is pruned against the live block list, and turning
  the toggle off releases everything still in it.

**Stop When Friend Joins** — independent of *Hide from radar*: it drives the same roster scan but
issues no block commands, so it works as a plain safety net with no blocking at all. When a friend
enters the town the player is teleported back up to the true node position (`lastNodePosition`) and
*then* the farm stops — that order matters, because the noclip restore rides the next frame, so
gravity returns only after the player is already above ground. Edge-triggered: it fires once per
friend arrival, not on every roster pass.

#### Show Blocked On Map

**Features → Main**, next to *Player Avatars (all)* / *Player Names (all)* — same "who can I see"
group, and useful on its own rather than only alongside Stealth Block.

`MapRevealBlockedFeature.cs` puts blocked players' dots back on the big map
and the minimap, so mass-blocking does not blind the map. Two Mono `NativeDetour`s, both opt-in:
`BlockingSystem.GetBlockStateByNetId` → `BlockState.none` (covers the minimap entirely and the big map
on open/add/filter refresh) and `MapSpotWidget.SetBlocked` → forced `false` (covers a block landing
while the big map is already open). Side effect: blocked players render in the world again at their
next stream-in — which does **not** make us visible to them. Not covered: floating name/head bubbles,
which filter through a different path (`IsPlayerInBlockList`), so the dot returns but the nameplate
does not.

### Aura Farm

Server-command style farming **without teleporting** to each node:

- Resolves game types at runtime via reflection (`ResourceProtocolManager`, `InteractSystem`, `EntityHelper`, `Entities`, etc.). Details: [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md).
- Primary target discovery: **AxeChecker** (`HandholdCylinderChecker.PhysicalSelect`) → level-object shapes with `ownerNetId`.
- Sends protocol commands in range:
  - **Bushes** — `SendPickBushCommand`
  - **Trees** — `SendAttackTreeCommand`
  - **Stones** — `SendHitStoneCommand`
- Throttled scan (80 ms tick, 20 ms per-owner cooldown); merged target cap (32).
- Toggle independent of teleport foraging; both can conflict — UI warns when radar/foraging preconditions fail.
- **Foraging + Aura Farm node-hop wait:** when START FORAGING teleports to a radar node with Aura Farm on,
  the hop to the next node waits for **confirmation of the collect** instead of a fixed 3 s dwell
  (long teleports need world-streaming time before the aura can even see the target).
  - **Fast path (`CollectColdEvent`):** the game dispatches
    `ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events.CollectColdEvent` per resource; multi-charge bushes
    (3 charges on a ~2.5 s server timer) emit decrementing `availableNum` while being drained and
    ONE final event with a real `endUnixTimeMs` when they flip to cooldown — that final event is
    the collect confirmation. The node's bush is bound by the charge-decrement pattern (captured
    aura owner ids are often aggregate level-object ids that never appear in events). On confirm
    the real cooldown is stamped into the radar (`ApplyLiveResourceCooldownByPosition`) so the
    ESP marker flips on the next 2 s rescan; the hop follows 0.25 s later. No aura-quiet gating —
    the aura re-spams every in-radius bush continuously, so quiet never happens in berry fields.
    `CollectObjectShowEvent(show=false)` covers despawn-style gathers.
  - **Authoritative live layer:** the map feature's mono collectable scan (position + `inCold` +
    `coldEndTime`) runs every ~2 s while the radar or foraging is active and is synced into the
    radar's local cooldown dicts (`SyncLiveResourceColdStates`) — markers/ESP show REAL server
    cooldowns shortly after radar enable, already-cold nodes are skipped before teleporting, and
    after a long teleport the wait resolves the node's true state as soon as its entity streams
    in (cold → immediate skip; warm → event flow; not streamed yet → keep waiting).
  - **Radar fallback:** node's marker flips to `[CD]` or is hidden by the cooldown stamp after the
    aura actually sent a command, with the aura idle ≥1.25 s (covers meteors and captures that
    never happened). Managed entity probing (`inCold`/`coldEndTime` reflection) is registered but
    dead on this build — XDT* entity resolution is Mono-only.
  - Bounded by the **Collect Wait Max** slider (4–30 s, default 12, `auraCollectWaitTimeout`);
    priority-anchor dwells keep the old fixed delay.

#### Meteorites (starfall rocks)

When live meteor props (`p_rock_meteorite*`) are near the player, Aura Farm treats matching AxeChecker targets as meteorites:

1. Scans scene for meteor GameObject positions (~1 s interval, 3 m match radius).
2. **Auto-equips axe** (hand tool id **1**) before mining.
3. Resolves **logic parent** `netId` from the view `ownerNetId` (`CollectableMeteoriteViewComponent` → `CollectableMeteoriteLogic` / `MeteoriteLogic`). `HitStone` must target the **parent**, not the view entity.
4. Sends `SendHitStoneCommand(parentNetId)` — same server path as `PlayerAxeAttackStoneAction`, not bush pick or F-key interact.
5. Refreshes target list and invalidates stale caches when moving between meteors (no toggle restart needed).

**Interaction with teleport foraging:** While Aura Farm is enabled, **meteor auto-interact** (F + UI click during START FORAGING) is disabled — meteors are handled only via Aura Farm API. Enabling Aura Farm also stops any in-progress meteor interact sequence.

**Requirements:** Player within axe range of the meteor; `ResourceProtocolManager.SendHitStoneCommand` (managed or Mono) must resolve. Debug: set `MasterLogAuraFarm = true` in `HeartopiaComplete.cs` and rebuild.

### Chop & Mine

Tree/stone **patrol automation**:

- Records patrol points with position **and** facing rotation.
- Walks route, chops trees / mines stones via game interaction pipeline.
- Separate saved patrol file: `tree_farm_patrol_points.json` (via unified config).
- Can integrate auto-repair pause like foraging.

### Fishing (`AutoFishingFarm`)

**This is the active fishing system on `main`.** (The legacy `AutoFishLogic` / `AutoFishFarm` input-simulation orphans were deleted.)

Behavior:

1. Ensures fishing rod equipped. Disabling leaves the rod in hand (it is not unequipped and the previously held tool is not swapped back in), so you can carry on fishing by hand.
2. Scans for fish shadows within detect range (15–200 m, default 60 m).
3. Resolves targets via server/netId-aware game APIs on `HeartopiaComplete`.
4. Casts, waits for bite, handles hook and **reel minigame** via `TrySetFishingPressed` (not legacy Input patches).
5. Tension-aware reel: emergency release below 0.15, resume pull above 0.35.
6. State machine with grace timers for stale states, post-catch recast, lost bait recovery.
7. **Instant Catch** (optional): spoof buoy `successLength` via AuraMono Reliable `SendCommand` — no avatar teleport. See [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md) § 2b.

UI displays user-friendly status:

- Scanning for fish, Waiting for bite, Fish hooked, Reeling, Catch secured, Fish escaped, etc.

Optional hotkeys: toggle auto fish, teleport fishing route (if configured).

**Note:** Startup log explicitly states `AutoFish subsystem disabled` — refers to the **old** `AutoFishLogic` pipeline, not `AutoFishingFarm`.

### Insects (`InsectNetFarm`)

- Auto equips insect net; the net stays in hand when the farm is stopped.
- Scans catchable insects in range (default 50 m).
- Batch catch (default 3 per tick).
- Optional **patrol teleport** through ~50 predefined world coordinates when no targets nearby.
- Pause teleport during auto-repair / auto-eat (configurable).
- Cooldown between catch attempts (default 1.5 s).

### Birds (`BirdNetFarm`)

- Auto equips bird scanner; the scanner stays in hand when the farm is stopped. Multi-catch support (1–10, default 1).
- Capture modes: **Safe Capture** vs **Spam Capture**.
- Perfect photo / auto-scare options.
- Safety stop after 90 s continuous run; 60 s re-enable cooldown.
- Stationary throttling reduces multi-catch when player barely moves.
- Pending server ACK tracking for burst catches.
- Optional crash trace logging to file when verbose flags enabled in source.

### Food & Repair

**Auto Repair**

- Opens bag UI programmatically, finds repair kit (standard or crafty), clicks Use, closes bag.
- Trigger modes: manual hotkey, toast notification, **durability percentage threshold** (default 10%).
- Optional teleport backward before repair (configurable distance).
- **The primary path is the trimmed game throw** (since 2026-08-06). Configs written before that
  are migrated once on load (`repairThrowPathTrimMigrated`), otherwise the switch would be invisible
  to existing installs; a later manual change sticks.
- **Instant Direct Throw** (default **off**) — sends `PutRecoverToolCommand` straight through
  `ToolRestorerProtocolManager.NotifyThrowToolRestorer`, skipping the CanPut round-trip, the
  `PlayerState.Free` gate and the whole throw clip, so a kit can go down mid-fishing/mid-farm. The
  cost is placement: it has to pick the spot geometrically (see below). Turn it on when a repair
  must land without an idle window; leave it off to let the game resolve the spot.
- **Drop Repair Kit At Feet** (default off, only meaningful while the above is on) — places the kit
  at the player's own position instead of 3 m ahead. Since the player is standing on the ground this
  is ground level by construction, so it is the mode to use on slopes, ledges, jetties and mid-jump;
  it also leaves the whole 5 m aura as margin. Off = 3 m ahead at the player's height, matching the
  game whenever the ground ahead is level (the normal case) and hanging in the air when it is not.
  Both apply the game's 0.3 m `toolRestoreSinkHeight`.
- **Trim Repair Throw Animation** (default **on**; applies only while *Instant Direct Throw* is
  OFF, i.e. on the default path) — keeps the game's own throw, and therefore its own correct placement (`TryFindThrowPoint`
  raycasts the real ground **and** resolves `parentNetId`, so on a ship the device rides the ship),
  while cutting almost all of the ~2 s animation. Source: `buddy/RepairThrowAnimationTrimFeature.cs`.
  The send is driven *by* the animation — the clip's "throw" signal calls `ThrowSomething()`, and
  only then does the Shoot tick reach `NoticeThrowSomething` — so the wind-up cannot be cancelled,
  only short-circuited. Three cuts, all public API + private-field reads over AuraMono, no native
  detour: invoke `ThrowSomething()` as soon as `_state == Start`; re-invoke
  `StartShoot(pos, 0.01f)` so the cosmetic 0.65 s hop finishes on the next tick (the command sends
  `_arg.targetPos`, never the hop's end point); `EndCasting()` once `_state == SendCommand` to drop
  the remaining ~1.2 s + idle wait. Gated throughout on `actionGraph.actionContext` being the
  tool-restorer arg. The CanPut round-trip and the `PlayerState.Free` gate remain — they run before
  any animation exists, which is why the direct send stays the right choice mid-fishing.
- **The direct throw cannot ground-snap, and this is not fixable with Unity APIs.** `XDT.Physics` is
  a self-contained physics engine — its `XDRaycastHit` carries an `int xdCollider` resolved through
  `XDCollider.GetColliderFromIndex`, not a Unity `Collider` — so there are no Unity colliders in the
  scene and `Physics.Raycast`/`Linecast`/`RaycastAll` from the mod hit nothing at all (measured
  2026-08-06: every distance, straight down under a standing player, 40 m reach, mask `~(1<<2)`).
  Real ground queries would have to AuraMono-invoke `MonoGame.ScriptFramework.PhysicsExtension`,
  whose `out XDRaycastHit` overloads are struct-outs (stack corruption via raw `mono_runtime_invoke`)
  — leaving the bool-only `Raycast(Vector3,Vector3,float,int)` plus a bisection on `maxDistance`.
  Not built. **Note this also means the ESP ground-ring raycasts have always silently fallen back to
  their anchor position.**
- The **Repair Status** row appends the placement the last direct throw resolved to
  (`Ready · forward 3m`, `Ready · at feet`), and every throw logs one `[AutoRepair] throw target`
  line with the resolved position, player position and facing.

**Auto Eat**

- Default food key: `food_bluejam` (configurable type / custom name).
- Eats until energy full or max attempts reached.
- Trigger: hotkey, toast, or energy % threshold (default 20%).

Both use hard-coded UI hierarchy paths under `GameApp/startup_root(Clone)/XDUIRoot/...` — **game updates can break these paths**.

Throttled background checks (`AutoEatTriggerCheckInterval`, `AutoRepairTriggerCheckInterval`) with slower intervals while farms active.

### Snow Sculpting

**Tab:** Features → **Snow Sculpting** (`UguiShellFeaturesSnowSculptingSubIndex`). Source: `buddy/SnowSculptureFeature.cs` (partial `HeartopiaComplete`); UI in `buddy/HeartopiaComplete.UguiFeaturesPuzzleSnowContent.cs`.

#### Auto Snow Sculpture

- Fixed report interval **10 ms**.
- **Self-starting, pure protocol (no interact / no `ExecuteHasTargetCommand`).** When no sculpture is active it resolves the snow base net id by, in order: (1) the cached base from a prior cycle this session, (2) the current interact target's level object → `ownerNetId` (when standing next to it), (3) a **50 m scan** of loaded entities — distance-filtered, then `EntityUtil.GetEntityResId` + `TableData.GetSnowbase(staticId)` to confirm it's a base, nearest wins. It then finds a snowball in the bag (`BackPackSystem.GetItemNetId(5100)`) and sends `PutSnowBall` + `StartSculpting`. A base needs exactly one snowball (`Idle→Prepared→Started`). Pure-protocol start does not open the panel or set the client `TargetNetId`, so the just-started base is treated as the active target **optimistically** and rounds begin; premature/redundant fills/starts are harmlessly rejected by the server. Base state is never read (avoids an unsafe struct-out component read). The old **Auto Click Icon** toggle (whose `ExecuteHasTargetCommand` spammed mono `icall.c` warnings) and the whole interact path were **removed**.
- **Pure API, no UI/panel interaction.** Per interval it resolves the active snow base (`SnowSculptureStatus.TargetNetId` via AuraMono / player status) and sends a perfect-round score with `SnowSculptureProtocolManager.ReportSculptingScore(baseNetId, score)` (AuraMono first, managed `ReportSculptingScore` / `SendCommand` fallback). The QTE panel's `OnPressDown` / `_lightButtons` path was **removed**.
- Round counter resets when the target base changes. After the **QTE successes** round target (slider below; hard-capped by `SnowSculptureMaxRound` 20) it finalizes: `StopSculpting(baseNetId)` (`StopSnowSculptingNetworkCommand`) so the server computes the sculpture from the accumulated score, then `GatherSnowSculpture(baseNetId)` (`SnowSculptingTakeNetworkCommand`) to take it. **Gather timing is event-driven**: on first enable the mod registers a per-netId EventHook for `S2C_SnowSculptingFinishEvent` (dispatched by `SnowSculptureProtocolManager.UpdateSnowSculpture` when the server's `SnowSculptingFinishComponent` syncs, payload = `SnowSculptingFinishedKind` int32) and gathers within one ~50 ms poll of the event (`SnowApiFinalizeEventPollSeconds`), with a **4 s** missed-event ceiling (`SnowApiFinalizeTimeoutSeconds`); while the hook isn't installed the legacy blind **2 s** wait (`SnowApiFinalizeDelaySeconds`) applies unchanged. The handler only records events matching the active target (a neighbour's finish can't mask ours), and a finish event arriving mid-rounds (server-side early cap) skips the remaining reports straight to finalize. After the take the cycle toasts and continues on the next sculpture (the toggle stays on; it only self-disables when the bag runs out of snowballs). Both calls are AuraMono-first with managed fallback and are fire-and-forget. The on-screen `SnowSculpturePanel` is **not** closed by the mod (no UI interaction); it dismisses on its own timer.
- **Start confirmation** (fixes the "Expired. Please place again" void cycles): the optimistic fill+start is verified before any reports are spent — per-netId `S2C_SnowSculptingStartEvent` (base synced to Started) confirms; a `S2C_StartSculptingResultEvent` with `isSucceed=false` (the direct ack of our start — e.g. the placed ball expired in `Prepared`) resets to the resolve path, whose fresh `PutSnowBall` replaces the expired fill (recovery = one 0.5 s backoff instead of 20 dead reports + the finalize ceiling). Silent 1.5 s timeout (`SnowStartConfirmTimeoutSeconds`) proceeds optimistically (missed-event escape hatch); 8 explicit rejections in a row (`SnowStartMaxConsecFails`) self-disable. Status/panel-resolved targets skip the gate (session already live). Hook-not-installed runs keep the legacy optimistic behavior.
- Status box: round progress `n/20` + cumulative count, last API status line, and `Balls used: X / limit` (or `(no limit)`).
- **Pacing sliders** (persisted, 0.05 s snap): **Start delay** (`snowStartDelaySeconds`, 0–1 s, default **0.3** — fill+start → first report pause) and **Next-cycle delay** (`snowNextCycleDelaySeconds`, 0–1.5 s, default **0.5** — gather → next fill pause). The reliable channel is ordered, so 0 is safe — premature sends are rejected harmlessly and retried.
- **QTE successes slider** (`snowQteSuccessCount`, whole 0–20, default **20**, persisted): how many perfect reports (rating id 2, `singleScore` 100) are sent per sculpture before `StopSculpting`; **0** = confirmed start → immediate stop (zero-score outcome). Table facts (`SnowParameter`): the legit session is **20 QTEs** (waves `1+2+2+15`, `totalTime` 20 s), so the default 20 = max score = the original behavior; lower values trade quality for variety (rating id 1 = miss/0; `SnowSculptingServer` value 0.2 suggests <4 perfects ⇒ Fail kind).
- **Snowballs in bag** counter — `BackPackSystem.GetUsableItemCount(5100, inSelfField:false)` via AuraMono, 1 s read throttle (refresh forced right after each gather and after the warehouse move); shows `?` pre-login (gated by `AuraMonoStaticFieldReadsAllowed`).
- **Snowball limit** field (persisted, default **0 = all**): auto-disables with a toast after N gathered sculptures (1 ball each); the used counter resets on every enable.

#### Auto Click Icon

- Configurable interval (default 50 ms).
- Replaces UI clicks on the tracking interact icon with the game interact pipeline:
  1. Collect interact targets (`InteractSystem` via AuraMono + static helper).
  2. `ConfirmExecuteHasTargetCommand` for snow commands **15** (start sculpt) and **14** (put snowball) — skip if confirm dialog required. Gather (**16**) is intentionally excluded: Auto Snow owns the take (StopSculpting → GatherSnowSculpture via protocol), so running it here would be a redundant gather (and an extra mono `icall.c` burst).
  3. `PlayerInteraction.ExecuteHasTargetCommand(levelObjectId, commandId)` (managed + AuraMono).
- Skips while the snow sculpture QTE panel is already open.
- Decompiled reference: `InteractTrackCellModel.TriggerOnClickByView` → same `ExecuteHasTargetCommand` call.

#### Move snowballs to backpack

- Button **Move snowballs to backpack** on the same tab.
- Scans **warehouse only** (`EStorageType` **2**), filters stacks with **`staticId == 5100`** (Snowball). Locked stacks are skipped.
- Sends `BackpackProtocolManager.MoveBatchBackpackItems` → bag (`targetStorageType` **1**), chunked at 256 stacks per batch (same as Bag/Warehouse transfer). See [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md).

#### Debug

- `MasterLogSnowSculpture` in `SnowSculptureFeature.cs` (default **false**) — `[SnowSculpture]` lines in `bugtopia.log`.

### Sand Sculpting

**Tab:** New Features → **Sand Sculpture** (`UguiShellSandSculptureSubIndex`). Source: `buddy/SandSculptureFeature.cs` (partial `HeartopiaComplete`); UI in `buddy/HeartopiaComplete.UguiSandSculptureContent.cs`.

#### Auto Sand Sculpture

- **Pure protocol, AuraMono-only** (the vanilla swing QTE is fully client-simulated in `SandSwingTrackCellModel` and only reports totals). FSM per cycle:
  1. **FindBase** — scan streamed `SandSculpturesComponent` views (`TryAuraMonoGetComponentObjects`), nearest base within **60 m**; reads `_componentData { baseStaticId, roughStaticId }` from the boxed struct via field offsets. If none is found and **Auto-place base** is on, goes to **PlaceBase** (below) instead of just re-scanning.
  2. **StartSculpt** — rounds = `TableData.GetSandrough(roughStaticId).interval.Length`; quality gate `FeatureOpenSystem.IsFeatureOpen(SandSculptingQuality=300041)`; sends `StartMakingSandSculpture` only. **`CanStartSandSculpture` (PreStart) is never sent** — its `PreStartSandSculptureEvent(Ok)` reply makes the vanilla client *join* the sculpt mode (`GameSandMode` → `TrackModule` opens the swing-QTE track) and the player FSM sends a duplicate Start → in-game "Error" tip + a stuck QTE track. The server accepts Start+Finish without the handshake, so the whole PreStart path (and its `TrackModule.EndSand` cleanup) was removed.
  3. **SendFinish** — after the configurable **Finish delay** slider (default 3 s) sends `FinishMakingSandSculpture(base, successCount, perfectCount)`: all-perfect `(0, rounds)` when quality is open, else the vanilla-max `(1, 0)`.
  4. **WaitRough** — polls (0.5 s, 12 s timeout) for the own `SandSculptureRoughComponent` (`ownerNetId == self`), reads `options[]` from its component data, then `ChooseSandSculptureProduct(roughNetId, productId)` (**rough** netId, not the base). **Never spoils, and prioritizes the collection:** the 14 real sculptures are `SandfinishedItem` ids **1–14**, decoys are **>14** (incl. name-trap duplicates 17/25/26) and picking a decoy yields `sandfinished 600299` = a **spoiled** sculpture. A draft carries **one or more** valid ids (≤14) + decoy fillers. When only one is valid there is no choice; when 2–3 are valid and **Prefer rare / uncollected models** is on, the mod ranks the valid ids by `(collectValue DESC, rarity DESC, id ASC)` — collectValue from the Pictorial (`PictorialSystem.TryGetPictorialData` → `_state`/`_starRate`: 2 = entry not collected, 1 = star below the current hobby-level cap, 0 = done), rarity from `Entity._rarity`, star cap from `HobbySystem.GetHobbyLevel(140)` (L1-2→3★, L3-4→4★, L5→5★). Fully **fail-closed** to smallest-valid-id. Map `SandfinishedItem 1..14 → Sandfinished 600100..600113` is a verified hardcoded array (`.research-record/sand-5star-priority.md`). Clears `PlayerDataComponent.SetSandRoughData(0)` afterwards.
  5. **CloseDialog** — the rough spawns next to the player, so the vanilla FSM opens the `DialogueSimplePanel` "choose model" dialog; our protocol Choose bypassed its callback, so nothing closes it. Polls (0.25 s, 3 s timeout) `UIManager.GetView(DialogueSimplePanel)` (Type from the class pointer — never `Type.GetType`) and invokes its protected `CloseSelf()`.
- **Auto-place base from backpack** (toggle, **off by default**): when FindBase finds nothing, place a fresh base ~0.8 m in front of the player via the game's generic build-placement command directly (no build-mode UI / camera), then rescan. **Out of sand bases in the bag stops the whole feature** (`autoSandEnabled = false`, not just auto-place) — no base can appear by retrying and the loop has nothing to sculpt. Other (non-terminal) failures disable just auto-place after 3 attempts. Path (`.research-record/sand-base-placement-helper.md`): scan bag for a `TableSandbase` item (`TableData.GetSandbase(staticId) != null`) → build a boxed `BuildPlaceData { BuildType=0, TransformData { LevelObjectNetId = putZoneId, LocalPos = root-local target, Angle, VirtualLinkLevelObjectNetId=[putZoneId] } }` where `buildRootNetId = LocalPlayerComponent.inFieldNetId` and `putZoneId = (ulong)root | (1<<32)` → `HomelandProtocolManager.SendBuildBatchOperation(bagItemNetId, buildRootNetId, IBuildData)` (the 3-param one-shot). No dedicated sand-place command exists; base placement goes through the generic build system. **No server position check** (build-overlap is bypassable).
- **Auto-collect finished sculptures** (toggle, **off by default**): independently of the sculpt FSM, scan `SandFinishComponent` views, and for each own freshly-made one (`SandFinishComponentData.onNewMake == true`) take it into the backpack via `CharacterProtocolManager.PoseDeleteBuild(entityNetId)` (→ `TakeItemNetworkCommand`, exactly what vanilla `GardenSandCommand`/interact 85 does). One at a time (`PoseDeleteBuild` gates on a single in-flight build option cleared by the server's `BuildOptionRespondEvent`), throttled ~1.5 s between takes. **Off by default** because a continuous every-tick scan caught a mono teardown window and AV'd (2026-07-09); the pre-flight `BackPackSystem.GetBlankCount()` check that faulted was removed — a full bag now just gets a harmless server-side reject.
- A base failing 3 times (start/finish rejected → rough timeout) is **blacklisted** for the session; "Reset base blacklist" button clears it. "Close stuck dialog" button force-closes a stray model dialog.
- **Hotkey:** Settings → Keybinds → **Auto Sand Sculpture** (rebindable, default unbound) toggles the main auto-sculpt on/off.
- UI (all localized — en/es/zh-CN/pt-BR/th): the auto-sculpt toggle, auto-place + auto-collect toggles, finish-delay slider, a compact status box (state / done / collected / last status / place / collect), and the two buttons. **Quality note:** the mod maxes the controllable QTE input (all-perfect), but the actual star cap is gated by the player's **Lepka/sand hobby level (theme 140, L1–5): 5★ only at L5** — see memory `sand-sculpting-qte-model`.

#### Debug

- `MasterLogSandSculpture` in `SandSculptureFeature.cs` (default **true** while the feature is fresh) — verbose `[SandSculpture]` lines; deduped status logging stays on regardless.

### Auto Buy

- Teleport → open cooking store → buy configured items → return.
- Master log flag `MasterLogAutoBuy` / `MasterLogForceOpenShop` in source.

### Buy All (Coin) — Selected Shop

- **Menu:** **Features** tab → same dropdown as **Force Open Shop** → **BUY ALL (COIN)**.
- **File:** `buddy/ShopBuyAllFeature.cs` (partial `HeartopiaComplete`).
- **Flow:** coroutine with 2-frame warmup → list goods → filter → buy loop (~100 ms between purchases). Status line under the button.
- **No UI clicks** — protocol only.

#### What gets bought

Includes only items where all of the following hold:

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| `storeMoneyType` | `StoreMoneyType.Currency` |
| `currencyType` | `CurrencyType.Coin` (1) |
| `isUnlock` | true |
| `leftCount` | > 0 |
| `price` | > 0 |

**Skips already owned** (not offered again):

- `boughtCount > 0` on limited-one slots
- `PlayerServiceSystem.GetItemCount(itemStaticId) > 0`
- managed path: `ShopItemData.isObtained`
- avatar rewards: `ShopSystem.CheckIfAvatarHasObtain` (AuraMono)

Coin balance is read via `PlayerServiceSystem.GetCurrencyCount(Coin)`; unaffordable items are skipped.

#### Purchase paths

| Store type | `storeId` | API |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| Normal NPC shops (cooking, garden, general, …) | per dropdown / resolved | `ShopShelfProtocolManager.BuyItem` (AuraMono); managed `ShopSystem.BuyItem(netId, count)` if types load |
| **Clothing Store** | **5** (`DressShopPanel`) | `ShopShelfProtocolManager.BuyClothes` (AuraMono `List<ClothesStoreEntry>`, `wear: false`) — **not** `BuyItem` |

Clothing buys **one piece per command** (game API), not stack count.

#### Listing goods

1. Managed: `ShopSystem.GetStoreGoodsData(storeId)` when `FindLoadedType` works.
2. Fallback AuraMono: same method on `DataModule<ShopSystem>` instance.

`ShopItemData` is read via **field-only** access in the Aura path (`_leftCount`, `rewardData.staticId`, …) — no property getters on structs (avoids crashes).

#### Unsupported shops

| Dropdown entry | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| Face Shop | Not a Coin `ShopPanel` store |
| Meteor / Starfall Exchange | Item cost (shards), not Coin — `WeatherExchangeShopPanel` |

#### Store IDs (Force Open / buy-all)

Same mapping as `TryResolveForceOpenShopStoreId` in `HeartopiaComplete.cs` (e.g. cooking **53**, garden **51**, clothing **5**, general store resolved at runtime). See **Force Open Shop** below.

#### Debug

- Errors always logged: `[ShopBuyAll] …`
- Verbose steps: set `MasterLogAutoBuy = true` in source (shared with Auto Buy).

### Force Open Shop

- Menu: **Features** tab → dropdown of hardcoded shops → **OPEN SELECTED SHOP**.
- Normal NPC stores: `ShopPanel.OpenShopPanel(storeId)` via AuraMono (`TryOpenShopPanelByStoreId`).
- Fortune rainbow/rain (wish stars): storeId **86** / **87** — still `ShopPanel`, not exchange.
- **Meteor / Starfall exchange** (Doris, starfall shards): `WeatherExchangeShopPanel.OpenWeatherExchangePanel` — storeId **140** (`MeteorStarfallExchangeStoreId`).
- How to add or debug similar panels (IL2CPP vs mono hooks, `storeId` discovery): **[TYPE_RESOLUTION.md § UI panels, hooks, and IL2CPP](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md#ui-panels-hooks-and-il2cpp-worked-example-weather-exchange-shop)**.

### Auto Sell

- **Scan source:** Bag only, Warehouse only, or **Both** (dropdown).
- **Obtain:** `BackPackSystem.GetAllItem` per storage (managed + AuraMono); optional runtime snapshot when scanning warehouse-only.
- **Filter:** configured item key (descriptor substring / `p_` photo prefix); **star filter** (0 = any, 1–5 = exact star); **skip 5★**; reserve count per group; max per stack; sell full stack.
- **Sort:** none — all matching `netId` stacks are aggregated and sold.
- Interval-based loop; can hide bag items from normal UI while running.
- **Icons:** item tiles (Auto Sell grid + Bag / Warehouse transfer grid + pet-feed food list) and
  the radar / Resource Visual ESP markers load icons **directly from the game**, always-on:
  staticId → `RewardUtility.GetIconName` → `ResManager.LoadSpriteAsync("ui_item_normal_…")`,
  copied into the shared in-memory texture cache on arrival (confirmed in-game July 2026). The
  legacy `CACHE ICONS` open-bag harvest and the entire disk PNG cache
  (`…\Bugtopia\Cache\ItemIcons`) were removed; only the dll-embedded `tree`/`rare_tree` radar
  icons remain baked in. Details: [ITEM_ICON_PIPELINE.md](./ITEM_ICON_PIPELINE.md).

### Mass Cook (Net Cook)

- Patrol-based mass cooking at saved cooking patrol points (position + rotation per station).
- Scans radius for cook targets; optional mini-game-only mode.
- Config: interval, scan radius, wait at spot, cooking speed.
- Coroutine warmup on mod init (`NetCookCoroutineWarmupRoutine`).
- **Ingredient model (Move Ingredients / max-quantity):** a recipe is a flat list of material slots, **one slot = one unit** (a recipe needing 3 wheat has 3 slots). A slot is either a **specific item** (ingredient id ≥ 100) or an **"any &lt;category&gt;" slot** (id &lt; 100 = a `FoodMaterialType`, e.g. "any fish" = `Fish`). Category slots carry `materialId == 0` and only set `materialType`. Requirements track `IsCategory`/`MaterialType`; `BuildNetCookDemands` aggregates per-dish counts (specific items vs categories), and warehouse move + max-quantity match category slots via `NetCookItemMatchesCategory` → `CookingSystem.CheckFoodTypeSatisfied` (cached). Cooking itself relies on the game's `AutoFill` to fill slots from the bag, so the mod only needs to move enough matching items. See [cooking ingredient details](DECOMPILED_SOURCE_MAP.md#312-cooking-net-cook--mass-cook).

#### Universal Ingredient top-up (`Use Universal Ingredient` toggle)

Fills the material slots real ingredients could not cover with the **Universal Ingredient** (万能食材, item **46999**, `CookingSystem.MagicIngredientId`), which substitutes any slot — specific or "any &lt;category&gt;".

- **Real ingredients always go first.** Order per dish: warehouse move (real stacks, low-star-first) → the game's own `AutoFill` from the bag → universal top-up for the slots still empty. While a warehouse batch is still landing in the bag the top-up is held back entirely (it would otherwise win the race and burn a paid item on an ingredient that was one frame away); the deferred start makes one final attempt with it enabled.
- The game never fills 46999 itself (`AutoSelectMaterial` skips it) and it matches no `FoodMaterialType`, so the mod places it explicitly via `CookingSystem.FillMaterialInSlot`. Candidates come from the game's own `GetSlotMaterials`, which lists 46999 **only** while the `CookCanUseMagicIngredient` feature gate is open — a locked account simply gets the usual "Missing ingredients" stop.
- **The top-up is applied again immediately before the send.** `PrepareCooking` transmits `_recipeDetail`'s per-slot `filledMaterialNetId`, not the caller's material list, and the AuraMono send path re-runs `InitCookingRecipeDetail` (hence `AutoFill`) right before it — which wipes any earlier top-up and would put netId `0` on the wire for that slot. Both the material build and the send therefore go through one shared slot walk, and the send bails out rather than transmitting a half-filled payload the server can only reject.
- **Ingredients max** grows with the toggle: the universal stock is a shared shortfall budget (one unit covers one missing unit of any slot), not a per-ingredient limit. **Move Ingredients** also pulls universal stacks out of the warehouse, but only for the deficit real ingredients left behind.
- Off by default and **session-only** — the toggle is not saved to config, so spending a paid item is always a deliberate choice for that session. 46999 also cooks at its own (low) star rating, which drags dish quality down (confirmed in-world: a dish topped up this way came back `quality=1`). Usage is force-logged (`universal ingredient filled N of M slot(s)` / `universal fill slot=i skipped: …`, throttled to 5 s) so a "Missing ingredients" drain always has a reason in the log.

#### Remote cooking (QTE at distance)

Cook commands (`PrepareCooking`/`StartCooking`/`InteractWithCooker`/`ContinueCooking`) are server-side and keyed only on the stable `LevelObjectNetId`, so they work at any distance. The blocker was **status visibility**: the QTE relief (`InteractWithCooker` on `Danger`) needs the live cooking status, but the mod read it from the **view** event `UpdateCookingStatusEvent`, which dies the moment the stove streams out (~17–85 m). Sending relief outside the Danger window instantly burns the dish, so blind relief is not an option — accurate remote status is mandatory.

- **Status source:** a MonoMod `NativeDetour` on the static `CookingProtocolManager.OnUpdateCookerStatus` — the ECS→data chokepoint the sync bridge calls for **every** server status update, independent of the streamed view. Confirmed in-world that `Danger`/`Cooking`/`Failed` arrive there at 85 m+ (Danger holds ~12 s, ample relief time). The detour body is allocation-free (records scalars into a ring + forwards via the trampoline); a main-thread drain feeds a **`levelObjectNetId`-keyed status cache** (`netCookStatusByLevelObject`). `TryGetNetCookTargetCookingStatus` reads this cache first (stable across stream-out/in, unlike the view `CookerNetId`). Installs whenever cooking is active; logging gated behind **Status Diagnostics**.
- **Remote completion:** the post-collect Idle reset travels via `ComponentRemoved<CookingStatusComponent>` (not `OnUpdateCookerStatus`), so the lo-cache never sees it at distance. The global `CookResultEvent` (`interaction == TakeFood`) is hooked as the remote "dish finished" signal → seeds the lo-cache to Idle and flags the stove collected so drain can remove it. Captured-but-never-cooked idle stoves (no status source at all at distance) are removed in drain once `Phase == 0`. Together these let a finite remote mass cook drain to zero and auto-stop.

#### "Same cooker" means "same menu" (capture grouping)

`IsCompatibleNetCookCooker` now groups the working set by the **recipe cooker type** (`TableCooker.cookerType`) whenever both sides resolve, instead of by cookware type or staticId. Two cookers sharing that value accept exactly the same dishes (`GetAllRecipes` keys on it), so they belong in one set. Both older rungs were wrong in opposite directions and are kept only as the fallback for cookers that cannot be classified:

- **by staticId** — splits a homogeneous kitchen: 灶台 `370001` and 简约灶台 `370002` are different ids with an identical 141-recipe menu. This was the live path on builds where the burner view reports cookware `0` (observed in-world: `Captured cookerStaticId=370001 cookerType=0`), so the minority style was silently dropped from every capture.
- **by cookware** — the same value is shared by cookers with different menus (the stove and the elephant food truck are both cookware Boil), and conversely one menu can span several cookware values, so it splits and merges in the wrong places both ways.

**`cookerType == 999` marks a cooker the client has switched OFF**, and it is excluded from grouping entirely (no census entry, no merge, no pin). Established in-world 2026-09-02:

- The table file is accurate — parsing `cn.bytes` row by row gives `370006 → 2`, `370010 → 3`, `370014 → 5`, `370019 → 6`, matching `tools/HeartopiaTables`.
- The live object is that same row (`GetCooker(370006).prefabPath` = `…/p_cooker_season_sandshop_cooker_1`) and its `cookwareType` reads **correctly** (2), while `cookerType` reads 999. A parse desync is ruled out: it would corrupt the adjacent field too. One field is overwritten at runtime, on cookers only.
- `TableCookingRecipe` is **not** gated: live `GetCookingRecipe` returns cookerType 2 / 3 / 5 / 6 / 15 for `45129` / `45216` / `45254` / `45274` / `45532`, exactly as in the file. So the menu buckets exist and are populated, while the cookers that own them are redirected to an empty `999` bucket — `GetAllRecipes` returns 0 for every one of them, i.e. the game itself will not serve their menu.
- Switched off is the contiguous id range **370006-370023** (it is not "seasonal vs not": winter cookers `370024`/`370025` work, the autumn cooker `370022` does not). No `TableCooker.OnAfterRead` subscriber exists in the Mono dump, so the gate is applied elsewhere (IL2CPP side or a server-sent table patch) — effect confirmed, mechanism not located.

Two consequences the code depends on: 999 is a **shared** bucket across unrelated cookers, so grouping by it would merge a crucible, a grill and a food cart into one "type"; and re-deriving the real type from the offline table would not help, because the recipe list still comes from the client's own bucket lookup.

Unrelated but easy to confuse with the above: `CookingSystem._cookingRecipes` is keyed by `cookerType` yet filled from the **player's learned recipes** (`InitData` → `ICookingClientService.GetAllCookingRecipes`), so live list sizes are per-account (28 for the stove menu, 2 for the tidal cooker on the test account) and never match recipe-table row counts.

`EnsureNetCookTargetsForCurrentRecipe` (the start-time gate) and `IsSameNetCookCookerFamily` (recipe-cache invalidation) use the same menu key, so the start filter cannot prune the set the capture just merged and a style change under the player does not throw away an identical recipe cache.

#### Stove Type picker (mixed kitchens)

Capture used to settle the stove kind by **majority vote** and silently drop every other kind, so a plain stove + a hot pot + a grill standing side by side left two of the three unreachable. The **STOVE TYPE** dropdown appears above RECIPE whenever the capture saw **2+ kinds in range**; picking one re-targets Mass Cook onto it and swaps the recipe list to that kind's menu.

- **Grouping key is the recipe cooker type** (`TableCooker.cookerType`), not the cookware type the capture pipeline normally compares (`CookingComponent.cookerwareType`, the mod's `netCookCookerType`). `CookingSystem.GetAllRecipes(cookerStaticId)` resolves staticId → `TableCooker.cookerType` → `_cookingRecipes[cookerType]`, so the recipe list is a pure function of that value, and several cooker staticIds can share one menu (e.g. `370001` and `370002` both resolve to type 1). The two keys are **not** interchangeable: the ordinary stove and the elephant food truck are both cookware "Boil" with different menus. Cookers whose live `cookerType` is `999` are excluded (see below). Resolved over AuraMono (`TableData.GetCooker(id,false).cookerType`, pinned across the getter invoke); the pre-existing `TryGetCookerTypeForStaticId` reads the same field through managed reflection, which is dead on IL2CPP.
- **Census:** every candidate the scan resolves is snapshotted (`netCookScannedTargets`) **before** the desired-type prune, then filtered through the same range/own-plot culls the working set passes. ⚠️ Capture has several sources and two of them **return early**, so a snapshot taken only in the caller sees an already-filtered set. `TryResolveNetCookContextsFromCookBuildComponents` is the live route on a homeland ("Captured N stove(s) from cook-build registry") and it voted + pruned *inside* its pinned AuraMono block; its tail now runs after `FreeAuraMonoPins`, where the full `discoveredTargets` is snapshotted and the menu cache primed. Symptom when this was missing: 54 stoves + 5 clay stoves in range, census reported one type and the picker never appeared. Priming there is also what makes the same-menu merge work on the **first** capture — `IsCompatibleNetCookCooker` is cache-only, so an unprimed cache silently falls back to the staticId comparison. Cook-build owners the deferred expansion rejected on type are folded in as a lower-bound count (shown as `x~N`). A kind whose recipe cooker type cannot be resolved never enters the census — the picker only offers types it can actually pin.
- **Picking a type** rebuilds the working set from that snapshot (no re-scan, no server traffic), swaps the recipe cache, then kicks the normal deferred expansion for the new type. The recipe for the incoming menu is chosen in this order: **what the user last selected for that menu** (`netCookRecipeByCookerType`, session-only), then the current selection if it happens to be in the new list, then the list's first entry. The memory rung matters: the head of a menu is not necessarily cookable — field log showed the clay-stove menu defaulting to `45519` and the start dying on `Missing ingredients for Prickly Pear & Apple Juice` on *every* switch, forcing a manual re-pick of `45524`. `TrySelectDefaultNetCookRecipeForCooker` (the capture path) consults the same memory before falling back to the first entry. If the snapshot holds nothing live for that kind, it falls back to a full capture with the pick applied.
- While a pick is active, `IsCompatibleNetCookCooker` compares by recipe cooker type and both preferred-getters vote only inside the pinned group. A pick with **no** match in a given scan is suppressed for that scan (the capture behaves as before the feature) and cleared afterwards with a status line — a stale pin can never empty a capture.
- **Session-only** and not saved to config: a pinned special-cooker type surviving a relog would make the next homeland capture 0 stoves for no visible reason. **Reset Capture** forgets it. Hidden in **Mini Game Only** and disabled while Mass Cook is running (a mid-run retarget would abandon cooking stoves).
- **Mini Game Assist ignores the pick entirely and assists every kind in range.** Relieving danger and collecting finished food work on any cooker, and `IsCompatibleNetCookCooker` already returns true for everything while `netCookMiniGameOnly` is set — but that only covers a scan that *runs* in assist mode. `netCookTargets` normally comes from a mass-cook capture that pruned to one menu, and switching assist on afterwards inherited the narrowing: field log showed 56 cookers in range with `STARTED mini-game-only cookerStaticId=370001 targets=51` (the 5 clay stoves ignored), and `targets=5` with type 16 picked (the other 51 ignored). `WidenNetCookAssistTargetsToAllCookerTypes` puts the other kinds back from the scan snapshot — on the assist start path and on the Mini Game Only toggle, so the STOVES counter is honest before Start. It applies capture's own distance rule (skipped under Remember Stoves) so it cannot pull in stoves the capture would have culled.

#### Permanent Stove Memory (`Remember Stoves` toggle)

Reuse a captured stove set on every start **without re-scanning**, so you can run Mass Cook anywhere without standing in your homeland.

- Captured stoves live in the in-memory registry `netCookRegisteredTargets`. With the toggle **ON**, restore (`TryResolveNetCookContextsFromRegisteredCache`) bypasses the distance/position culls (`RemoveOutOfRangeNetCookTargets` skipped; missing world position no longer drops a stove) — cooking uses the stable `LevelObjectNetId`, not position. After a cook finishes, the cook context persists so the next start restores the **full** remembered set instead of cooking only the last stove.
- **Reset Capture** clears the registry (the "forget" action — use after switching homelands).
- The toggle is saved to config. The registry itself is **session-only**: view/lo netIds are reassigned across game restarts, so re-capture once per login.

### Puzzle (`PuzzleNetFeature`)

- Detects puzzle UI open state.
- Reads piece layout from game objects / net IDs.
- Auto-solves placement puzzle when enabled.
- Shows `Solving...` / `Waiting for puzzle target...` status.
- Disables itself after successful solve or on error.

### Pet Care

**Pet Feed (`PetFeedFeature`)**

- Feed all visible cats or dogs in sequence.
- **Scan radius** slider (1-50 m, default **50** = old behaviour). Culls the world entity walk
  against `TryGetLocalPlayerPosition` **before** the per-entity component walk, so it is also a
  scan-cost win, and **before** the `seenPetNetIds` dedupe — which makes the rule *the radius
  culls strangers*: a culled owned pet is re-added by the `PetSystem.GetPetComponentDatas` pass
  (that source carries no position at all), a culled stranger's pet is in no such list and stays
  gone. Persisted (`petFeedScanRadiusMeters`); scan log reports `radius= outOfRange= noPos=`.
  With no player anchor the radius is not applied and the log says so.
- Cooldown between bulk feed runs.
- Per-pet single feed from UI list.
- Food list from `PetSystem.GetFoods()` (not a full-bag scan); sorts by **lowest fullness** first, then `staticId`.
- Optional selected-food filter in UI.

See [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#pet-feed-detail).

**Pet Play (`PetPlayFeature`)**

- **Auto Cat Play:** answers cat QTE prompts automatically.
- **Auto Dog Train:** handles dog training QTE flow.
- Independent toggles + hotkeys.

**My Pets (per-pet Play / Wash)**

- `Show My Pets` lists owned cats/dogs (PetFeed scan, `IsMine` only) with live energy (vitality) / food (fullness) / growth (chemistry) from `PetSystem.GetPetComponentData`; per-row message shows detailed session progress.
- **Play** — cat: protocol-only headless tease session (`MeowProtocolManager.BeginTease`, no game mode → no status panels; instant QTE answers via the event hook; `CatPlayExitForUiEvent`/`CatPlayPromoteForUiEvent` suppress-forwarded while active; Stop cancels silently via `CancelTease`); dog: headless training (`PrepareTease` → `BeginTease(learningId)`), picking the first **unfinished** learning motion, else the first unlocked one (`PetSystem.GetMotionDatas` + `TableDogLearningMotion.unlockGrowth`). Dog rounds are answered ONLY after the per-netId `TeaseDogPlayEvent` (+0.5 s) — the same answer-window signal `DogPlayStatusPanel` uses; the performance motion syncs seconds earlier, so motion-based timing bounces off the closed window. Choice = shared resolver core `TryResolveDogQteChoiceForLearning` (dog motion vs table motion / requireLearningId), also used by Auto Dog Train. `[PetPlay][dog]` trace lines log every server event / motion change / send while a dog session runs.
- **Energy** — per-row button feeding ONE energy snack. These are **not foods**: `PetSystem` sorts hobby-tool items (`TableDogfooditem.isHobbyTool` / `TableCatfooditem.catHobbyTool` — Energy Dog Food / Energy Fish Jerky) into a separate `_toolItems` list behind `GetTools()`, which neither Feed All nor the food dropdown ever sees; `InitFoods(entityType)` scans **backpack and warehouse**. Sends `PrepareFeed` → `BeginFeed(netId, [], toolNetId)` — empty foods list, item in the `HobbyToolNetId` slot — then waits for the `Energy increased` tip (259), with a 1 Hz vitality poll and an 18 s timeout as backstops. Picks the **weakest** available snack so stronger ones are conserved. Greyed out at full vitality (`baseMaxVitalityPoint` from `TableKittyThemes`/`TableDogThemes` — the same cap `CatFeedPanel` gates its tool slot on, toast 10133); the stats line shows `energy N/max` so a greyed button explains itself. Joins `TryGetPetCareBusyLabel` (so it blocks and is blocked by Play/Wash/train loop) but **not** `IsPetCareEntryActiveSession` — no `Stop` button, since the feed always ends on its own.
- **Wash** — headless bath loop: `PetBathinghBegin` → `PetBathingRoundStart` per round driven by `PetBathClickResultClientEvent` / `PetBathRoundEndClientEvent`; no `PetBathPanel`.
- Pre-checks mirror the game's interact gates: hungry (fullness 0), dog energy (`vitality < TableDogThemes.teaseVitalityPointDecrease`); server rejections map to row messages ("already clean", "no stamina", "only at home", …).
- **Train until all learned (+energy food)** toggle: with it on, Play runs a loop — repeat headless sessions until every unlocked action is learned; when the pet is hungry/out of energy it auto-feeds the ENERGY item (the feed "hobby tool": `TableDogfooditem.isHobbyTool` / `TableCatfooditem.catHobbyTool` — Energy Dog Food / Energy Fish Jerky) via `BeginFeed`'s `HobbyToolNetId` slot, then continues. Stops when done, when energy food runs out, after 3 fruitless feeds/failed sessions, or via the row `Stop`.
- One headless session at a time; the active pet's row shows `Stop`. `PetTeaseBeginResultEvent` is suppressed during dog sessions so `TrackingDogPlay` never opens the result panel.

## Radar Tab

### Core radar

- Scans world for configured resource prefabs / markers.
- Categories: mushrooms (incl. truffle), berries, stones, ores, trees (apple, mandarin, rare), fish shadows, meteors, misc event resources.
- **Daily** group — **Oak-Oak** and **Flawless Fluorite**, the two daily-roaming advanced
  collectables (their own group: single objects that move every game day at 06:00, not a resource
  family). The server picks the spot and the client has no data that predicts it, so they are found
  by scanning the live advanced-collectable view components as soon as the object streams in; a
  marker that reads as on-cooldown means today's harvest is already done. Once found, the position
  is remembered for the session and its marker ignores the Max-distance slider, so walking away
  does not hide it. One "located" toast per world session. Range cannot be extended — see
  [DECOMPILED_SOURCE_MAP.md](DECOMPILED_SOURCE_MAP.md).
- Toggle per category; select all / clear all.
- Max distance slider (25–1000 m, default 75 m).
- Marker styles: **Default** (icon markers) or **Simple Text**.
- Force refresh scan button.

### Resource Visual ESP

Overlay drawn on top of game view for radar markers:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable/disable | Tied to radar config |
| Style | Beacon, Card, Minimal |
| Show distance | On-screen distance label |
| Connector line | Line from marker to screen edge |
| Offscreen indicators | Arrows for off-camera targets |
| Scale / opacity | Visual tuning |
| Max markers | Cap (default 120) |

Uses embedded tree icons for some marker types.

### Game map display ("Game" mode)

Native in-game markers instead of (or alongside) the ESP overlay — see [RADAR_GAME_MAP.md](RADAR_GAME_MAP.md).

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ESP Overlay / Game Map | Route selected resources to the screen overlay or to the native map |
| Map Markers (nearest) | Cap on how many nearest resources are tracked (1–30, default 5) |
| Show on big map | Also place markers on the big map (default **off**; on adds the game's tracked rectangle frame) |

The former **Player Avatars (all)** row moved to Features → Main on 2026-07-30 and was split there into
independent **Player Avatars (all)** and **Player Names (all)** toggles. Radar → Settings' **Reset Defaults**
no longer touches either.

- Per-resource native icons (timber/stone/bamboo/fruit/mushroom), rare tiers (e.g. Rare Timber), players' native pin, Bird/Fish/Insect category icons.
- Shows on the minimap + in-world tracking pointers; big map is opt-in.
- **Meteors** reach the big map too (with their Starfall Shard icon). They have no collectable-atlas sprite,
  so this needs a detour that lets their item-icon track drive a map spot — see
  [RADAR_GAME_MAP.md](RADAR_GAME_MAP.md#meteors-on-the-big-map--the-issametype-widening).
- Cooldown/depleted resources are hidden (authoritative via `CollectableObjectComponent.inCold`).

### Priority locations

Weighted preference for specific forage types when multiple markers compete (fiddlehead, tall mustard, burdock, mustard greens).

---

## Teleport Tab

- **Preset lists:** home, animal care, NPCs (runtime cache), fast travel, events, houses.
- **Custom teleports:** add current position, name entry, persist to unified config.
- Teleport implementation sets `OverridePosition` + frame counter to hold player at destination through patched movement.
- NPC list rebuilt from game data when available.

---

## Bag / Warehouse

- Scans **Bag** or **Warehouse** through `BackPackSystem.GetAllItem` (AuraMono), one row per `netId` stack.
- Grid sorted by **display name** (A→Z); user picks stacks (no auto “cheapest” picker).
- Transfer sends `BackpackProtocolManager.MoveBatchBackpackItems` (`BatchMoveNetworkCommand`, max 256 stacks per request; mod chunks larger batches).
- Direction: Bag → Warehouse (`targetStorageType = 2`), Warehouse → Bag (`targetStorageType = 1`).
- Does **not** require opening the in-game bag, warehouse tab, or multi-select UI.
- Optional **Multi** mode: click stacks to build a batch, set quantity, then **Transfer**.
- Locked stacks are shown but skipped on send.
- **Warehouse Anywhere:** while the game bag UI is open, unlocks the **full** bag/warehouse page away from home: warehouse tab, single-item move, long-press multi-select and the multi-select panel with the full-stack toggle (scoped `IsPlayerInHomeLand` spoof active only while the bag is open; does not move items by itself).

Full pipeline: [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#bag--warehouse-transfer-detail).

## New Features — Animal Care & Daily Quests

### Wild animal feed (`WildAnimalFeedFeature`)

- Scans **backpack** via `GetAllItem`; matches food allowed for the animal **group** (fullness table per `staticId` + star).
- **Skip 5 Star Food** (default on): never uses 5★ food.
- Picks food with highest score: bond EXP (favorites weighted) + fullness contribution.
- Manual **Feed**; separate from daily quests.

### Wild animal gifts (`WildAnimalGiftFeature`)

- **Claim All Wild Gifts** (Animal Care tab): collects pending gift `netId`s from loaded ECS entities, then calls `AnimalProtocolManager.TakeGift` per target (~0.45 s between claims).
- **Pending count:** `WildAnimalProtocolManager.HaveGift()` → `IWildAnimalService.HaveGift()` (AuraMono) returns `AnimalGroup` ids with red-dot gifts.
- **Target discovery (AuraMono only):** entity scan over `TryEnumerateAuraMonoLoadedEntityObjects` — for each `netId`, `AnimalProtocolManager.GetNetworkEntity`, then:
  - **Gift boxes:** `AnimalUtil.IsGiftBox` + `AnimalUtil.GetGroup` must match a pending group.
  - **Animal-carried gifts:** `WildAnimalProtocolManager.HaveGift(EcsEntity)` + `AnimalUtil.GetGroup` in pending groups.
- **Claim:** `AnimalProtocolManager.TakeGift(uint)` → `AnimalGiftTakeNetworkCommand`.
- Does **not** use managed `EcsService.TryGet<IWildAnimalService>`, `DataCenter.TryGetComponentData`, or level-object scan (those paths fail or are redundant under BepInEx).
- Details, logs, troubleshooting: [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#wild-animal-gifts-detail).

### Daily Quests

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Auto submit items** | For orders in **CanSubmit** state, builds `List<ItemNetPair>` on game Mono and calls `ClientSubmitTaskItem` / `ClientSubmitNpcTaskItem`. |
| **Skip 5 Star Items** | Excludes 5★ stacks from submission (saved in config). |

**Item selection (auto submit):**

1. Enumerate **backpack + warehouse** (`EStorageType` 1 and 2).
2. Match targets via `CheckSubmitItems` (all targets) and `CheckSubmitItem`; honor `quality` on target rows.
3. Sort matches: **lowest sell price**, then **lowest star**.
4. Fill `needNum` from cheapest stacks; skip locked and (optional) 5★.

Does **not** use `AutoSubmitNpcTaskItem` success alone — that only opens NPC dialogue in vanilla UI.

Details and troubleshooting: [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#daily-quests-detail).

## New Features — Pictures (ScreenCapture)

Decrypts `persistentDataPath/ScreenCapture` to `ScreenCaptureDecrypted` (AES, same as game `EncryptUtil`). **Encrypt changed** re-imports only files whose plain SHA256 differs from `.bugtopia-manifest.json`.

**Draw** files are palette index maps (`TextureFormat.R8`), not normal photos. On decrypt:

- `Draw/{id}_{w}_{h}.png` — colored RGBA preview (editable)
- `Draw/.index/{id}_{w}_{h}.png` — original index PNG for lossless roundtrip

Palette comes from the in-game `drawing_lut` texture (128 colors; cached as `ScreenCaptureDecrypted/.drawing_color_lut.png`). Edited colors outside the palette are quantized to the nearest entry on re-encrypt.

**Upload edited drawing to the server** (open the drawing at your easel first): **Extract open drawing** dumps the live canvas to `ScreenCaptureDecrypted/drawing.png`; edit it; **Upload drawing.png** pushes the pixels to the server (DrawBoard protocol) and refreshes the in-game preview/thumbnail. This is server-authoritative — editing the local cache alone does **not** change the drawing in-game.

CLI parity: `tools/screen_capture_crypto.py` (`decrypt` / `encrypt-changed` / `decode-draw` / `encode-draw`; `pip install pycryptodome pillow`). Palette files: `tools/gen_drawing_palette.py`.

**Full technical reference (types, AuraMono access, protocol): [DRAW_TECHNICAL.md](./DRAW_TECHNICAL.md).**

### UGC Texture Cache (Self → Game LOD, under Furniture & Buildings)

Fixes photo frames / movie screens / custom-photo furniture (jigsaw puzzles, display shelves, decals — anything carrying a UGC photo from another player) rendering **blank/white**. Root cause chain: every one of those surfaces routes through one chokepoint — `XDTViewBase.Loader.DownLoadTexture2dAdvancedLoader` (confirmed call sites: `PhotoFrameComponent`, `MovieScreenComponent`, `UGCPhotoComponent`, `BrgDisplayComponent`) — which checks `XDTBaseService.Services.Cache.LocalTextureCacheService`'s on-disk LRU cache before falling back to an OBS cloud download. Three of its pools (`Limit/`, `Announcement/`, `Draw/`) are hardcoded to **100 entries** (`LocalTextureCacheService.OnCreate() → Init(100)`; `Photo/`/`Head/`/`NoBgPhoto/` are effectively unbounded at 100000) — evicting the LRU tail **deletes the file on disk**, so a town with 100+ distinct UGC photos churns through re-downloads, and any hiccup during that leaves a permanently blank texture until the next successful fetch. This is a real, confirmed bug, but **not the whole story** — see below.

| Control | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Purge Texture Cache** | Deletes every file under `ScreenCapture`'s `Photo/`, `Head/`, `Limit/`, `Announcement/`, `NoBgPhoto/` (pure re-downloadable caches of other players' content — clears corrupted/stuck files). Coroutine-driven, yields every 200 files. Deliberately excludes `Draw/` (owned by the Pictures decrypt/upload workflow) and `ScreenCaptureDecrypted` |
| **Raise cache capacity** toggle + slider (100–2000, default 500) | AuraMono field write: `LRUPool<T,T1>.capacity` is a plain private `int` compared against `size` in `Put()` — not baked into a fixed-size array — so raising it is one field write via `Managers`-independent static fields `LocalTextureCacheService._texture2dCacheManagerForLimited/Announcement/Draw` → `._lruPool` → `.capacity`. **Verified every ~5s**, not fire-and-forget; reverts to the game's own default (100) when switched off |

**This card lives next to "Extend furniture draw distance" because that setting is what actually caused the blank textures** — and the real mechanism turned out to have nothing to do with this cache at all:

> **`PhotoFrameComponent.PhotoLodDis` is a hardcoded `{100f, 100f, 100f}`**, and `Tick()` calls `DownLoadTexture2dAdvancedLoader.Create(...)` **only** while the player is within that radius (`_lodDisSqr`, cached per-spawn in `OnSpawned`). Vanilla furniture streaming (`RenderLoadConfig.LoadDis = [80,30,30,24]`; photo frames/screens/display items are ordinary furniture = tier 2/3) spawns them only within **24-30 m** — far inside that 100 m gate, so it never binds. The game's design silently assumes *furniture-spawn-radius ≪ photo-request-radius*. Extending furniture draw distance **inverts** that: one distance for all four tiers with the slider clamped 100..9999, and the voxel streamer expands in square *rings* (Chebyshev), so box corners reach ≈`dist × √2` while the photo gate stays a 100 m *sphere*. Every frame spawned in that shell is visible but **never requests its texture** → renders white. No slider value avoids it (minimum 100 ≥ gate 100), which is exactly why only switching the feature off worked.

This also explains why purge, raising the LRU to 2000, and un-scaling the per-frame load pacing all failed: the request was never even issued, so it was never a cache-capacity or throughput problem. Fixed in `TryGameLodSetPhotoRequestDistance` (`GameLodFeature.cs`): `PhotoLodDis` is `public static readonly float[]` — the *reference* is readonly, the *contents* are not — so the mod writes its elements via `mono_array_addr_with_size` (pinned; resolved by fully-qualified name, since an unrelated empty-bodied `PhotoFrameComponent` stub also exists under `...Component.GuiChar`). Apply writes `furnitureDistance × 1.75` (ring-corner margin so the request sphere always contains the spawn box); revert restores 100. Because `_lodDisSqr` is cached at `OnSpawned`, it affects frames spawned *after* the write — precisely the distant ones that were blank.

Two related facts found in the same investigation, worth knowing when tuning this page: **"Max objects" counts *distinct* `staticId`s, not instances** (`LoaderManager.furniturenNumMap` is keyed by staticId, `currentNum = .Count`, and tier-0 bypasses the cap), so lowering it barely reduces how much furniture is resident — distance is the real lever. And the game's UGC photo pipeline has **no retry and no timeout** for world furniture (`OnLoadFailed` only logs; every world-furniture `Create` uses the default `timeout = -1f`, which skips the timeout check entirely), so any load that does fail stays blank until that object respawns.

A third control — a `NativeDetour` on `DownLoadTexture2dAdvancedLoader.OnDownLoadFailed` that logged each failing load — was tried and **retired 2026-07-26** after it crashed the game on three separate live hits (WER dumps), each immediately after its own log line printed. This matches a documented prior failure mode for this exact technique (detouring a `mono_compile_method` JIT entry — see `auramono-native-hook-and-settings-gotchas` project memory: the same approach already hard-crashed `InstrumentPanel.OnStart/OnStop` and `ActivityEventModule.CreateActivityBubble` on this build).

Implementation: `UgcTextureCacheFeature.cs` (backend) + the "UGC TEXTURE CACHE" section in `HeartopiaComplete.UguiGameLodContent.cs` (UI, no IMGUI twin).

## New Features — Homeland Farm

Crop-box (planter) farming inside your homeland. All operations are **radius-based** around the player and send real server commands. Implemented in `HomelandFarmFeature.cs` (resolved via reflection + **AuraMono** native path — managed component types are absent under BepInEx).

Tab layout (top → bottom):

1. **Auto Farming** — Capture planters + Start / Stop.
2. **Farm Radius** — single slider (1–80 m) driving every operation below; **persisted to config**.
3. **Crops** — seed source (Backpack / Warehouse / Both), Refresh seeds, seed selector.
4. **Fertilizer** — fertilizer source, Refresh fertilizers, fertilizer selector.
5. **Operations** — buttons: Water in radius · Harvest · Weed · Collect seeds · **Sow** · **Fertilize** · Log diagnostics.
6. Status panel + **Stop** (cancels the running operation).

### Manual operations (radius)

| Button | Action | Owner filter |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Water in radius | Waters crop boxes + plants (batch = watering hobby-skill cell count) | any |
| Weed | Removes the `hasWeed` flag on crops | any |
| Harvest | Collects ripe crops (`stage == 4`) | **own only** |
| Collect seeds | Collects ready plant seeds | any |
| Sow | Fills empty planter slots with the **selected seed** (batch = sprinkler/hobby cell count) | own |
| Fertilize | Applies the **selected fertilizer** to own crops | own |

Item names in the seed/fertilizer selectors resolve through the same game-table path as the Bag / Auto Sell tabs (`TableData.GetBackPackName` first), so labels match across the mod.

### Auto Farming

**Capture planters** snapshots the crop boxes in radius (like Mass Cook "Capture Stoves") and pins the working-zone center. **Start auto farm** then runs an autonomous loop (disabled until seeds are selected):

1. **Discovery first** — one radius scan builds a crop-netId cache (so it never re-sows already-occupied planters on restart).
2. **Poll** the cached crops directly (no re-scan): remove weeds, harvest ripe crops, drop them from the cache.
3. **Sow** a new generation **only when the zone holds no crops** (start, or after the whole generation is harvested) and a post-sow cooldown has elapsed — prevents re-sowing boxes the server hasn't registered yet (`MaxPlantCountLimit`).
4. **Time-scheduled weeding** — sleep is driven by the crops' exact maturity (`mature = sowTime + ripeGrowTime − growTime`, read from `CropItemData`; "now" via the game clock `GameTimeUtility.GetUnixTime()`). Coarse weeding while far from ripe; **weed every second in the final minute** before harvest.

**Stop:** manual (Stop button / Stop auto farm), or automatic once the selected seed runs out **and** the last harvest is collected.

Enable `MasterLogHomelandFarm` for per-tick logs (`Auto crop timing`, `Auto poll`, `next ripe in …`).

### Entity discovery — the scan funnel

Every farm operation (manual button, hotkey, auto-farm, capture) resolves its target net-ids through one funnel, `TryHomelandFarmCollectFarmEntityNetIds` in `HomelandFarmFeature.cs`. Sources are tried in order; cheap/cached ones first, the expensive native walk last:

| # | Source | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | RegisteredCache | Persisted targets from earlier discovery. Skipped for capture (`useAutoFarmCollectShortcuts:false`) and skips zero-position entries in spatial scans. |
| 2 | InteractSeeds | Current interact-target seeds. |
| 3 | **ComponentRadius (direct ECS)** | `Entities.GetComponents<CropBoxComponent/CropComponent/PlantComponent>` via the AuraMono generic-invoke path. **This is now the primary source** and returns the authoritative crop-box + crop + plant set. |
| 4 | SphereQuery / Cylinder | Entity spatial queries — return 0 on this build. |
| 5 | LevelObjectCache | In-memory level-object position cache (crop boxes are level objects). |
| 6 | AuraProximity | Walks the nearby-entity list and classifies each — the native, crash-prone path. |
| 7 | AuraEntities | Full recursive loaded-entity graph walk — the most crash-prone path. |

**Key change (June 2026):** the direct-ECS source (#3) used to be considered unsafe and was gated off, so discovery fell back to the crash-prone proximity / graph walk (#6/#7), which randomly hit uncatchable native access-violations on **visiting other players' fields** (shared local coordinates, streaming entities). The AuraMono `GetComponents<T>` path was brought up and now works reliably (see [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md → AuraMono generic `GetComponents<T>`](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md#auramono-generic-getcomponentst-direct-ecs-query)). When #3 succeeds, a `componentRadiusSucceeded` flag now **skips both #6 and #7 on every path**, removing the native-AV exposure. The proximity / graph walk only runs as a fallback if the direct query returns nothing (e.g. a field with no crop boxes, crops, or plants).

Caps still apply as a safety bound on the fallback walk: the inspect cap and global entity/level-object enumeration caps are raised to 8192 for dense homelands.

## New Features — Extras (Ice Skating)

The **Ice Skating** sub-tab (`UguiShellIceSkatingSubIndex`) hosts two independent ice-skating tools, laid out top → bottom in `buddy/HeartopiaComplete.UguiIceSkatingContent.cs`: the network-sequence buttons first, then the auto-skating controls underneath. Backends are `IceSkatingSequenceFeature.cs` and `AutoIceSkatingFeature.cs`:

1. **Perfect Ice Skating** (network sequences) — `IceSkatingSequenceFeature.cs`.
2. **Auto Ice Skating** (real-time bot) — `AutoIceSkatingFeature.cs`.

### Perfect Ice Skating (network sequences)

Server-command driven runs that don't require you to be skating in real time:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Challenge (5 perfect, 1500) | Runs a scripted challenge sequence aiming for a perfect score (~1500). `Runs` field sets repetitions. |
| Perfect Drill | Repeated perfect-action drill. `Runs` field sets repetitions. |

A run count field (`DrawIceSkatingRunCountField`, clamped to `IceSkatingSequenceMaxRunCount`) sits beside each button. Only one sequence runs at a time (`iceSkatingSequenceCoroutine` gate). Loader log tag: `[IceSkatingSeq]`.

### Auto Ice Skating (real-time bot)

`AutoIceSkatingFeature.cs` — a `partial class HeartopiaComplete` split. Watches the local player's `GameSkateMode` each frame and **chains skate tricks automatically while you still control movement**. Toggle it on the Extras tab or via the **Auto Ice Skating** hotkey (Settings → Keybinds → PLAYER, default unbound).

**Type resolution.** **AuraMono only** (`mono_runtime_invoke`). A managed-reflection twin used to run first and be kept at parity; `GameSkateMode` / `LocalPlayerComponent` / `TableData` are `XDT*` types that never reach the BepInEx interop, so it could not resolve on this build and was removed in the 2026-08-13 purge. Resolved surfaces: `LocalPlayerComponent.GetGameMode<GameSkateMode>` (or `Character.GetMode<…>`), `GameSkateMode` (`SkillTrigger`, `CanTriggerUltimate`, `CalculateSpeedRate`, `IsReceiver`, `GetRatioInConfiguredPhase`, `actived`, `Energy`, `SkateSkills`, `UltimateSkill`, `_currentCastAction`, `_skateActions`, `ChallengeInfo`), and `TableData` (`GetSkateAction`, `GetSkateActionType`, `GetSkateActionState`, `GetPairSkateUltimate`). Resolution retries every 5 s until the player enters the rink; a circuit breaker disables the tick after repeated exceptions.

**Decision logic per frame** (`TickAutoIceSkating` / `TickAutoIceSkatingAura`):

1. **Not skating / inactive / pair-receiver** → idle. Pair *receiver* is manual-only (the partner drives). After entering the ice there is a short warm-up, and at challenge start a 3 s countdown is skipped.
2. **Performing an action** → first try an ultimate (see below); otherwise honour the **Perfect move** setting.
3. **Idle (no action playing)** → try an ultimate, else pick and trigger the next simple move.

**Simple-move selection** (`PickAutoIceSkatingBestSkill`): for each skill in the current tree it reads whether the action is **new** (challenge novelty bonus, `ChallengeData.IsNewAction`) and its **duration** (sum of phase spans from `TableSkateActionState.phase`). Ranking:

- **Prefer new move** on (default): new actions outrank used ones; ties broken by shortest duration.
- **Prefer new move** off: ranked purely by shortest duration.

**Perfect-move timing** (`TryAutoIceSkatingTryPerfectInterrupt*`):

- **Perfect move** on (default): the next move is triggered inside the perfect window (`GetRatioInConfiguredPhase` over the action's `prefectPhase`), so each chained trick scores its perfect bonus.
- **Perfect move** off: the next move is chained **as soon as the game allows an interrupt** (the game's `SkillTrigger` still gates blend time / non-interruptible phases) — faster chaining, no waiting for perfect.

**Ultimate selection** (`TryAutoIceSkatingSelectUltimate*`): scans the skill tree, resolves each branch's ultimate via `GetSkateActionType(actionType).ultimateActionId`, scores it, and picks the **shortest ultimate whose final score ≥ the Ultimate-cost slider**. Energy gate:

- **Only x2 ultimate** on (default): an ultimate is cast only at energy tier ≥ x2 (≥ 200 energy).
- **Only x2 ultimate** off: tier x1 (≥ 100) is allowed.
- **Last 30s ultimate** on (default): when the challenge timer drops below 30 s, the gate falls to x1 regardless of the above — spend stored energy before it's wasted at time-up. The score floor (slider) still applies.

Ultimate scoring mirrors the game's `GameSkateMode.SettleActionEnergy` / `CalculateBaseScore`: `final = (score + bonus·if-new) × (1 + prefectScoreRatio) × speedRate × repeat-decay`, where `speedRate` is 0.5–2.0 from `CalculateSpeedRate()` (your real speed) and pair skates override score/bonus via `TablePairSkateUltimate`. Keep your speed high for the ×2 multiplier. The scan result is cached briefly (≈0.35 s) keyed by the skill-set hash.

**Controls** (Extras tab, under the network buttons):

| Control | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Auto Ice Skating (toggle) | off | Master enable. |
| Ultimate cost (min score) — slider | 900 | Minimum final score an ultimate must reach to be cast. Range 0–2000, step 50. |
| Only x2 ultimate (skip x1) | on | Require energy tier x2 for ultimates. |
| Last 30s ultimate | on | Allow x1 ultimate when challenge timer < 30 s. |
| Perfect move | on | Off → chain moves as soon as available, not waiting for the perfect window. |
| Prefer new move | on | Off → pick simple moves purely by shortest duration. |

All controls and the hotkey are **persisted** in the keybind config (`KeybindConfigData`); defaults come from field initializers, so configs predating this feature upgrade to on / 900.

**Debug logging.** `MasterLogAutoIceSkating` (top of `HeartopiaComplete.cs`, default `false`). When enabled, every trigger and every ultimate skip logs the full property dump of the action(s) — `id type dur score bonus new prefScore energy prefEnergy iconTip pair ult` — and selection logs list each candidate the same way, so you can see exactly how moves differ (duration, score, bonuses) and why an ultimate was skipped (`below-min` / `ok`).

**Crash-hardening.** `GameSkateMode.ChallengeInfo` is a **struct** (`ChallengeData`) read raw into a stack buffer via `mono_field_get_value`. `mono_field_get_offset` is boxed-relative (includes the 16-byte object header), so the Aura path subtracts `2 * IntPtr.Size` for `UsedActions` / `Timestamp` / `Duration`; a missing subtraction read `Timestamp` as a fake pointer and hard-crashed mono at challenge start. Pointers read from the raw buffer are also alignment/`>= 0x10000` checked before any `mono_object_get_class` (native AVs are uncatchable). See `memory/auramono-struct-field-offsets.md`.

## New Features — Extra (Analog Move)

**Tab:** New Features → Extra. **Source:** `MovementInputFeature.cs`.

### Analog Move (gamepad stick)

Drives the local character from an analog axis "as if from the joystick", without teleport/noclip.
Heartopia is mobile-first: movement runs through the new **Input System** `Move` action
(`InputEvent.Move == 0`), **not** legacy `Input.GetAxis`. A connected gamepad's stick is **not bound**
in the action map, so the native stick does nothing — and legacy `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"/"Vertical")`
returns 0 under "Input System (New)". This bridge fixes that.

- **Source:** Xbox left stick read directly via **Win32 XInput** (`XInputGetState`, `xinput1_4.dll` →
  `xinput9_1_0.dll` fallback; left-thumb radial deadzone 7849/32767, normalized 0..1). WASD/arrows also
  drive it. Raw joystick space (x = right, y = forward) — the game applies the camera-relative transform.
- **Injection:** the resolved axis is fed into `LocalPlayerComponent.OnLeftJoystickPerformed(Vector2)`
  (deterministic — the player's own tick consumes its `_joystickQueue` → `SetMoveJoystick` → real
  velocity + server sync). Fallback: `MonoInputManager.SendMoveValueToControl(Vector2)`.
- **Merge / safety:** yields to the on-screen touch joystick; respects the mod's menu movement block
  (`ShouldBlockGameplayInput` / the game's `IsInputDisabled(Move)`); per-frame tick guarded by a
  `FeatureBreakerState`. Movement uses the genuine move component at legitimate speed, so it passes the
  server `MovementAntiCheating` checks and leaves no `InputCheatManager` touch trace.

Pipeline details: **[TECHNICAL.md § Analog movement bridge](./TECHNICAL.md)**; resolver facts in
`memory/analog-move-injection.md`.

## New Features — Extra (Carpet Stamp)

**Tab:** New Features → Extra. **Source:** `CarpetStampFeature.cs`.

Research tool for the party **stampede carpets** — Slippery Rug `260242` (`p_mechanism_party_acceleratecarpet_1`, +20% move speed) and Slime Rug `260243` (−20%), plus the start/end point rugs `260240`/`260241` (listed scan-only).

- **Scan Carpets** — walks the static `UGCWorld._uActors` dictionary (one `UActor` per UGC mechanism on the map) via AuraMono with GC pins, reads each actor's `StaticId` / `UgcType` / entity position, and lists everything with `UgcType.StampedeInteraction` (1002) or a known carpet staticId, sorted by distance. Every actor found is logged (`[CarpetStamp]`), carpet or not.
- **Step On** (row button / **Step On Nearest**) — sends a single self-reported step-on: `UgcOperateCommand { Type = actor UgcType, NetId = carpet, OperateMethod = (UgcOperateMethod)enterSkillId }` through the AuraMono-inflated `WebRequestUtility.SendCommand<UgcOperateCommand>` (Reliable). The server runs the skill's `UgcServerAction` itself — Slippery Rug: **AddBuff 1003** (+20% speed, no expiry until removed).
- **Step Off** — completes the cycle like a real exit: both `PlayerExit` skills in `ugcSkills` order (AddBuff 1005, +20% for 3 s linger, then RemoveBuff 1003).
- **Logging** — always on, no toggle: resolution pointers, dictionary walk per-actor lines (netId/staticId/ugcType/pos/dist), full command payloads, invoke results/exceptions.

Skill ids are per-staticId constants recovered from the decrypted `cn.bytes` tables (`Mechanism.ugcSkills` → `Ugcskill` → `UgcServerAction`/`BuffConfig`); the game-side pipeline this replays is `UGCTriggerCase → LocalPlayerComponent.TriggerEnter → PhysInteractionSystem → PhysEventSkill → Action_Command_UgcOperate`. Research: `/ugc-mechanism-carpet-interaction.md`.

## Research Tab

A practical panel for the Research Institute (research store is StoreId **142**). Opening the tab auto-prepares everything: it polls the server-sync instrument cache immediately, arms the level spoof, and force-spawns the institute's client entities (all silent, main-town only) — so the list and buttons are ready without any setup. System map: `.research-record/RESEARCH_STORE_REPORT.md`.

**Instruments** (live from the server-sync cache — works from any location):

| Element | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Per-analyzer row | `Analyzer N · Lv L` + status: **idle**, **researching &lt;item&gt; · Xh Ym** (countdown interpolated from the last poll), or **DONE · &lt;item&gt;**. Item names via `TableData.GetEntity`. |
| SELECT ITEM (per row) | Opens that analyzer's `ResearchInstrumentPanel` (the research-item picker). **Greyed out while the analyzer is busy** (still researching). Full start needs the client instrument — the tab force-spawns it on open, so it works from anywhere in the main town; a busy/idle instrument opens fully, netId is the real server netId. |
| Completion alerts | Background poll (5 s, from OnUpdate) fires a menu notification the moment a running research crosses its completeTime (`Analyzer N finished researching <item> — ready to collect`). One-shot per completion; always on. |

**Panel shortcuts:**

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| RESEARCH STORE | Opens `ResearchShopPanel` via `UIManager.OpenView`. The level spoof (auto-armed on open) makes it render from any location. |
| CONTROL CONSOLE | Opens `ResearchControlPanel` (the platform panel) the same way. |

Behind the scenes (no UI, automatic): the level spoof NativeDetours `ResearchSystem.GetResearchLevel()`/`GetResearchExp()` to return the server-sync values when the client read is 0 (so panels don't NRE off the building); force-spawn sets `DynamicMapItemService.creatResearchStuff=true` + dispatches `ShowHideResearchStuffEvent{isShow=true}` to materialise the client entities with their real server netIds. Reads only — research upgrades stay disabled. Session-only, world-gated, AuraMono-gated.

---

## Music Tab

Plays **RECM `.bin` note timelines** — the gramophone recording format (`tools/bgm_to_bin.py`
converts MIDI/sheet text into it; the game's own recordings use the same bytes).

| Control | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| PLAY / STOP | Plays the selected track; stop releases all held notes |
| Loop | Restart after a 1 s gap when the clip duration elapses |
| Network mode (experimental) | Streams `PlayInstrumentNetworkCommand` batches via `MusicProtocolManager.PlayInstrument` (AuraMono) so others hear the notes at the player entity — no instrument needed. Local Wwise echo plays in both modes (`AkSoundEngine.PostEvent` on the player; the server never echoes your own notes back) |
| TEST NETWORK ECHO | Sends one press/release standing still and watches `InstrumentInfoFromServer` for our own `playerNetId` — echo proves the server relays standless notes (see `memory/instrument-play-protocol.md`) |
| Source | `%LocalLow%/Bugtopia/Music/*.bin` (drop converter output here) ⇄ game records `<persistentDataPath>/record/**` |
| Rescan / Open folder | Refresh the catalog / open the active source folder in Explorer |
| Track list | One row per `.bin`: `>` marks the selected track, the row label selects, the trailing Play/Stop button drives that track directly. Capped at 60 rows; any overflow is reported in the catalog line |

Scheduling is main-thread in `OnUpdate` (frame-quantized — same fidelity as the game's own
gramophone player); note-ons that come due >150 ms late (frame hitches) are dropped instead of
burst-played, note-offs always fire. On play the feature loads the Wwise instrument banks for the
track's instrument types itself (mono `AudioManager.LoadStaticBank`, unloaded on stop) and
registers/positions the player GameObject with the AK engine — raw `PostEvent` bypasses the game's
lazy bank loading, so without this the notes are silent (`playingId 0`). Verbose diagnostics via
`MasterLogMusicPlayer` (`[MusicPlayer]` log lines). Persisted: loop, mode, source, selected track.

The tab is its own top-level sidebar entry (display position 8, ahead of Settings) —
`HeartopiaComplete.UguiMusicContent.cs`; playback itself lives in `MusicPlayerFeature.cs`.

## Settings Tab

Sections typically include:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Keybinds | All hotkeys listed in BUILD doc + feature-specific binds |
| UI Theme | Accent, text, tab, window, panel colors; opacity; scale; HSV picker |
| Localization | Language: en, es, zh-CN, pt-BR |
| Notifications | Enable, screen position (9 positions) |
| Overlay | Status overlay toggle |
| Performance | FPS bypass; **FPS Watchdog** (see below); LOD override (game default / better / performance / custom bias & max level) |
| Misc | Restore defaults, export-related options |

Config persisted to `%LocalLow%/Bugtopia/Config.xml` (XML serialized `UnifiedConfigData`). Persisted values include keybinds (incl. **Water + Weed Radius**), theme, radar, patrols, bird farm, and the **Homeland Farm radius** (`homelandFarmWaterRadius`, clamped 1–80, default 30).

Separate legacy-compatible JSON fragments still loaded line-by-line for some keys in older migration path.

### FPS Watchdog (Settings → Main → Performance)

Frame-time monitor. Writes a log line every time the frame rate degrades, so "it stutters sometimes"
becomes a timestamped number with context instead of a bisection session. **Default ON**;
implementation `FpsWatchdogFeature.cs`.

Two detectors, because the two failures look nothing alike:

| Detector | Fires when | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Hitch** | one frame takes longer than the threshold — an asset load, a GC pause, a blocking IO call, a scan that walked too many entities in one tick | ≥ **120 ms** (slider 40–1000) |
| **Sustained drop** | the smoothed rate sits under a floor for ≥ 0.5 s — a crowded map, an automation loop that now costs real time every frame | below **max(30 fps, 60% of this machine's baseline)** (slider 10–120) |

The floor takes whichever of the two bars is *higher*: on a 144 fps rig a slide to 45 fps is a real
regression an absolute floor of 30 would never see, and on a 35 fps rig the relative test alone would
fire constantly. The baseline is a slow EMA that **excludes** hitch and in-drop frames, so an anomaly
can never quietly become the new normal.

A drop logs on **entry** as well as on recovery. That is deliberate: a drop that ends in a freeze or a
crash never reaches the recovery line, and the entry line is then the only evidence it happened.
Long drops also emit a "still ongoing" line every 10 s.

**Attribution — was it the mod?** Every line carries how many milliseconds of that frame `OnUpdate`
itself spent, and which stretch of it was the most expensive. The section boundaries are the
`Breadcrumbs.Phase()` markers `OnUpdate` already carries (`ou.lod`, `ou.uguishell`, `ou.dailyclaims`,
…), borrowed through `Breadcrumbs.PhaseObserver` — no new call sites, and one
`Stopwatch.GetTimestamp()` (~25 ns) per marker. Caveat when reading the output: a section is measured
from its own marker to the next one, so it includes that marker's breadcrumb file write.

```
[FpsWatch] hitch 214 ms (4.7 fps) [+3 more since the last line] | mod 3.21 ms (worst ou.uguishell 2.90 ms) | now 41.2 fps, baseline 59.7 | Town scene 1 | pos 123.4,12.0,-45.6
[FpsWatch] DROP START fps 22.4 (floor 35.8, baseline 59.7) | mod 1.10 ms | Town scene 1 | pos ...
[FpsWatch] DROP END (recovered) after 12.3 s | avg 21.8 fps, min 9.1 fps, worst frame 190 ms, 268 frames | mod avg 1.44 ms peak 11.20 ms (worst ou.hud 8.10 ms) | baseline 59.7 | ...
[FpsWatch] 60s window: avg 58.4 fps, 1% low 31.2 fps, worst frame 132 ms | 12 hitches, 1 drops (8.4 s) | mod avg 0.90 ms peak 14.10 ms (worst ou.dailyclaims 6.20 ms)
```

Other behaviour worth knowing:

- **Output goes to both sinks, always** — the mod log (what an agent tails live) and
  `%LocalLow%/Bugtopia/Logs/fps-watchdog.log`, which survives the loader log and is the file to
  attach to a stutter report. It appends across sessions and is reset once it passes 4 MB.
- **Rate limited**, and that is load-bearing: hitches arrive in bursts, and a line per hitch would
  turn a 200 ms stall into a 2 s one. At most one hitch line every 2 s; everything suppressed in
  between is counted and reported on the next line that gets through (`[+N more…]`).
- **Suppressed during loading screens, world transitions and the login level**, plus a 3 s grace
  while streaming settles — otherwise every zone change would report a "drop".
- **The 60 s summary only prints when there is something to say** (a hitch, a drop, or a 1% low under
  70% of the average); an otherwise clean session gets one anchor line every 5 minutes. The 1% low
  comes from a frame-time histogram, so there is no per-frame sample buffer and no sort.
- **`Settings → Logging → "FPS Watchdog (verbose)"`** adds the full per-section table on every hitch
  and every window. The event lines themselves are *never* gated on it.
- Changing either threshold re-arms the detector (the smoothing was filled under the old bar).
- Live reading is also on the MCP `env` payload as `runtime.fpsWatchdog` / `runtime.modFrameMs`.

Cost when enabled: a handful of float ops, one timestamp pair and one array clear per frame. When
disabled: two bool tests per frame, and the phase observer is unhooked.

Rebind by clicking the button in Settings and pressing a new key. Mouse buttons are bindable too. Layout note: panel section heights are sized by row count (`BeginKeybindSection` rowCount) and the scroll height by `CalculateSettingsTabHeight` — both must be bumped when adding rows, or the new rows render outside the panel/scroll.

## Master Log Switches (Settings → Logging)

Verbose logging is controlled by `static bool MasterLog*` flags, declared next to the subsystems
they trace (most in `HeartopiaComplete.cs`, the rest in the feature file that uses them). **50 of
them have a checkbox** in **Settings → Logging**, driven from the single
`BuildUguiLoggingToggleBindings()` array in `HeartopiaComplete.UguiSettingsMainContent.cs` — adding a
new flag means adding one entry there, or it silently has no UI. (`LoggingTabRowCount` in
`HeartopiaComplete.Logging.cs` pins that count; a mismatch is logged when the tab is built.)

**All 50 are persisted** (`KeybindConfigData`, saved in `PopulateKeybindConfig`, restored in
`ApplyKeybindConfig` — field names match the flags 1:1, so the XML is greppable). Because the tab's
Set lambdas are bare field setters, the save is committed by the checkbox wrapper in
`BuildUguiShellSettingsLoggingContent`; a binding added without it changes the flag in memory and
reverts at the next launch.

**49 default to `false`; `MasterLogGatherScan` defaults `true`.** A config written before a flag
existed simply lacks the element, and XmlSerializer then leaves whatever the config field's own
initialiser set — which is why `KeybindConfigData.MasterLogGatherScan` carries `= true` as well.
That is the pattern to copy for any future default-ON setting; the missing element means "compiled
default", not "false".

Previously the whole set was session-only, so a flag you switched off came back on at the next
launch. That is fixed; the trade-off is the opposite one — a flag left on now stays on across
restarts and will keep writing to the log until you turn it off.

Flags that are **not** reachable from the tab and stay session-only:

| Flag | Why |
|---|---|
| `chatTranslateVerboseLog` | prints a line per chat message; explicitly skipped in `PopulateKeybindConfig` and forced `false` in `ApplyKeybindConfig` |
| nine `MasterLog*` flags with no row | never given a binding, so neither persisted nor switchable at runtime: `ActionPanel`, `AutoLearn`, `CraftAnimSkip`, `CraftDirectSend`, `EmoteUnlock`, `ForagingAnim`, `MusicPlayer`, `RepairThrowTrim`, `TutorialBlock` — the last still defaults `true` |

## Source Files Not in Build

Legacy / experimental files on disk but **excluded from `buddy.csproj`**:

| File(s) | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `AutoFishLogic.cs`, `AutoFishFarm.cs`, `AutoFishGet*.cs` | Old fishing; replaced by `AutoFishingFarm` |
| `InsectFarm.cs` | Replaced by `InsectNetFarm` |
| `MonoEcs*.cs`, `RuntimeDump.cs`, `FishingAutoDump.cs` | Research / dump tooling (see `test` branch) |

Loader entry points **`MelonLoaderPlugin.cs`**, **`BepInExPlugin.cs`**, **`ModLogger.cs`**, and **`ModCoroutines.cs`** are compiled and required for every build.

## Safety and Fair Play

- Many features send **real server commands** (aura farm, bird/insect catch, fishing press state) — not purely client visual.
- Bird farm includes deliberate rate limits and safety stops.
- Use private sessions; automation may violate game Terms of Service.
