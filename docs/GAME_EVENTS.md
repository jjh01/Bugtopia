# Game Events (EventCenter) — Reference & Mod Integration

How Heartopia's in-game event bus works, how the mod can (and can't) plug into it,
and the full catalogue of event types. The flat list of all ~1450 events lives in
[GAME_EVENTS_LIST.md](GAME_EVENTS_LIST.md).

> **Events-first policy.** When adding a new feature or reworking an existing one that **reacts to a
> game state change**, search [GAME_EVENTS_LIST.md](GAME_EVENTS_LIST.md) for a suitable event and
> prefer a hook (`RegisterGameEventHook` / `RegisterGameEventHookByNetId`, §3) over per-frame polling
> or AuraMono scans — using the event-primary + poll-fallback pattern (`IsGameEventHookInstalled`).
> Keep polling only for genuinely *continuous* per-frame values (camera-dependent ESP projection,
> battle reel pull-strength — events mark *transitions*, not continuous state) or where the existing
> poll is already cheap and build-independent (Unity uGUI text-input focus). See AGENTS.md §7/§10.

## 1. The bus: `XDTGame.Core.EventCenter`

Source: [`ilspy-dumps/XDTBaseService/XDTGame.Core/EventCenter.cs`](../ilspy-dumps/XDTBaseService/XDTGame.Core/EventCenter.cs).

A static, type-keyed publish/subscribe hub. Every event is a **`struct` that implements
`XDTGame.Core.IEvent`** (a marker interface, no members). Handlers are keyed by the event's
`System.Type`, so dispatch is O(1) on a `Dictionary<Type, ...>`.

```csharp
public static class EventCenter
{
    // Global listeners
    public static Delegate AddListener<T>(in Action<T> action)    where T : struct, IEvent;
    public static void     RemoveListener<T>(in Action<T> action) where T : struct, IEvent;
    public static void     DispatchEvent<T>(in T @event)          where T : struct, IEvent;

    // Per-entity listeners (keyed by netId, e.g. "this specific bird")
    public static void AddListener<T>(uint netId, in Action<T> action)    where T : struct, IEvent;
    public static void RemoveListener<T>(uint netId, in Action<T> action) where T : struct, IEvent;
    public static void DispatchEvent<T>(uint netId, in T @event)          where T : struct, IEvent;

    // Non-generic overloads (subscribe by Type + Delegate)
    public static void AddListener(Type eventType, in Delegate action);
    public static void RemoveListener(Type eventType, in Delegate action);
}
```

Internals worth knowing:
- Global handlers are stored in a `LinkedListExecutor` (a pooled singly-linked list per event
  type, newest-first via `AddHead`). Per-netId handlers live in `subExecutors[netId]`.
- `Dispatch` wraps each handler invocation in `try/catch` and logs via `DebugSystem.LogError`
  — **a throwing listener does not break the dispatch chain**, and the throw is swallowed
  into the game log, not surfaced to other systems.
- `DispatchEvent(netId, …)` is a **no-op if nobody registered for that netId** (no auto-create
  on dispatch — only `AddListener(netId, …)` creates the sub-executor).

### Canonical usage (from game code)

[`InstrumentModule.cs`](../ilspy-dumps/XDTGameUI/XDTGUI.Module.Instrument/InstrumentModule.cs)
is a textbook subscriber:

```csharp
// register
EventCenter.AddListener<InstrumentPanelOpenEvent>(new Action<InstrumentPanelOpenEvent>(OnInstrumentPanelOpen));
EventCenter.AddListener<InstrumentPanelCloseEvent>(new Action<InstrumentPanelCloseEvent>(OnInstrumentPanelClose));
// ... later, on teardown ...
EventCenter.RemoveListener<InstrumentPanelOpenEvent>(new Action<InstrumentPanelOpenEvent>(OnInstrumentPanelOpen));
```

---

## 2. Instrument open/close flow (concrete, end-to-end)

This is the chain behind the InstrumentHotkeyGuard feature, traced through the dumps:

1. The player starts/stops playing — [`PlayerInstrumentMotion.cs`](../ilspy-dumps/XDTLevelAndEntity/XDTLevelAndEntity.Gameplay.Locomotion/PlayerInstrumentMotion.cs)
   dispatches the **root** events:
   - line 250: `EventCenter.DispatchEvent<InstrumentPanelOpenEvent>(new InstrumentPanelOpenEvent { … })`
   - line 207: `EventCenter.DispatchEvent<InstrumentPanelCloseEvent>(default)`
2. [`InstrumentModule`](../ilspy-dumps/XDTGameUI/XDTGUI.Module.Instrument/InstrumentModule.cs)
   listens for those and re-broadcasts higher-level mode events:
   - `InstrumentPanelOpenEvent` → `InstrumentModeStartedEvent`
   - `InstrumentPanelCloseEvent` → `InstrumentModeEndedEvent`
3. [`InstrumentPanel`](../ilspy-dumps/XDTGameUI/XDTGame.UI.Panel/InstrumentPanel.cs) is the UI
   view; `OnStart` builds the keyboard / `OnStop` tears it down. Its fields `_instrumentType`
   (`InstrumentType` enum) and `_nowKeyOption` (`MusicKeyOption` enum) are read via AuraMono
   `GetView` only on the mod's **fallback** path; the primary path now reads the `InstrumentType`
   straight from the `InstrumentPanelOpenEvent` payload (§3).

### The four instrument events

| Event | Namespace | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InstrumentPanelOpenEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | `InstrumentType InstrumentType; uint instrumentNetId; ulong instrumentLevelObjectNetId; int staticId;` | player begins playing |
| `InstrumentPanelCloseEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | *(empty, Size=1)* | player stops playing |
| `InstrumentModeStartedEvent` | `XDTGameSystem.UI` | `InstrumentType instrumentType; int staticId; uint instrumentNetId; ulong instrumentLevelObjectNetId;` | re-broadcast of open |
| `InstrumentModeEndedEvent` | `XDTGameSystem.UI` | *(empty, Size=1)* | re-broadcast of close |

Enums (for reading payloads / panel fields):
- `InstrumentType` ([dump](../ilspy-dumps/EcsClient/XDT.Scene.Shared.Modules.Music/InstrumentType.cs)):
  `None=0, Piano=1, Conga=2, KaHongDrum=3, BaYinTong=4, EtherealDrum=5, Harp=6, Lute=11 … Saxophone=21, Conch=22`.
- `MusicKeyOption` ([dump](../ilspy-dumps/EcsClient/XDT.Scene.Shared.Modules.Music/MusicKeyOption.cs)):
  `KeyMode8=0, KeyMode15a=1, KeyMode15b=2, KeyMode22=3`.

## 3. How the mod hooks game events — the reusable engine ✅

The mod runs under BepInEx as a **separate .NET assembly**; the game's managed types
(`XDTGame.*`, the `IEvent` structs) are **not loadable** as compile-time references and are
absent from the mod's runtime (see `memory/homeland-farm-scan-perf.md`). The game executes in
its own embedded **AuraMono** runtime. That rules out simply calling
`EventCenter.AddListener<InstrumentPanelOpenEvent>(…)` in C#.

**Solution (implemented, proven in-world):** NativeDetour the inflated generic dispatcher
`EventCenter.DispatchEvent<T>(in T)` for the concrete event type and forward to the original via
a trampoline. We intercept at the dispatcher entry, so we see **every dispatch of that type**
regardless of who (if anyone) subscribed. This is wrapped in a reusable engine:
[`HeartopiaComplete.EventHook.cs`](../buddy/HeartopiaComplete.EventHook.cs).

### Public API

> **Install timing (since 2026-07-26).** `RegisterGameEventHook` only records metadata — it may be
> called from anywhere, at any time, and does **not** need the world. The native detour, however, is
> installed from the **world-ready gate** (`InstallGameEventHooksOnWorldReady`), not from `OnUpdate`:
> inflating `DispatchEvent<T>` while the game's Mono images are half-up faults inside the runtime
> and makes the runtime abort the process (WER `xdt.exe.7988`/`30332` on
> `DispatchEvent<StartCookEvent>`, `xdt.exe.34488` on `DispatchEvent<LoadingOpenedEvent>`).
> **There are no exceptions any more:** the gate used to exempt its own transport
> (`LoadingOpenedEvent`/`LoadingClosedEvent`), but those hooks were deleted in phase 3 — the gate
> reads the game's level FSM (`GameWorld`) directly instead, so nothing needs to install pre-world.
> Consequence for callers: a hook registered at startup starts firing shortly after the world comes
> up, not before. Never add your own retry loop to `OnUpdate` to "help" it —
> see [TECHNICAL.md §World-ready gate](TECHNICAL.md#world-ready-gate-heartopiacompleteworldreadycs).

```csharp
// payloadBytes = the event struct's size from the dump (how many bytes to snapshot; 0 for empty
// events like *CloseEvent). The handler runs on the Unity main thread (OnUpdate drain), so it may
// allocate / log / call AuraMono freely. The native detour body only Marshal.Copy's the payload
// into a reused buffer and forwards — it never allocates, throws, or calls into Mono.
RegisterGameEventHook(string eventFullName, int payloadBytes, Action<GameEventSnapshot> handler);

// Per-ENTITY events — dispatched via DispatchEvent<T>(uint netId, in T) (e.g. dog QTE). The
// dispatch netId arrives in GameEventSnapshot.NetId. (Don't register the same name both ways.)
RegisterGameEventHookByNetId(string eventFullName, int payloadBytes, Action<GameEventSnapshot> handler);

// In the handler, read scalar fields by offset (string/object/Type fields can NOT be read this way):
void OnSomeEvent(GameEventSnapshot e) {
    uint  who = e.NetId;          // dispatch netId for per-netId events, 0 for global
    int   t   = e.ReadInt32(0);
    uint  net = e.ReadUInt32(4);
    ulong id  = e.ReadUInt64(8);
    float f   = e.ReadSingle(16);
    byte  b   = e.ReadByte(4);    // byte-backed enums
    bool  on  = e.ReadBool(12);
}
```

Registration is idempotent per event name (re-registering adds another handler to the shared
detour). Install is lazy: the engine retries each frame from `ProcessGameEventHooksOnUpdate` until
AuraMono + `XDTGame.Core.EventCenter` + the event's image are loaded, then splices the detour.
`IsGameEventHookInstalled(name)` reports when a detour is live (for an event-flag-with-poll-fallback
pattern). Cap: `MaxEventHookSlots` (128) distinct event types **per session** — slots are never
released, so the budget is every name registered over the run, not what is hooked right now.
A refused registration only returns `false` and logs a warning: the feature keeps running
without that event (this is how "My Pets -> Play never ends" happened at the old cap of 48).
Reference consumers:
[`InstrumentHotkeyGuardFeature`](../buddy/InstrumentHotkeyGuardFeature.cs) (global) and
[`PetPlayFeature`](../buddy/PetPlayFeature.cs) (cat = global, dog = per-netId).

### Global vs per-netId dispatch (important)

`EventCenter` has two dispatchers ([EventCenter.cs](../ilspy-dumps/XDTBaseService/XDTGame.Core/EventCenter.cs)):
`DispatchEvent<T>(in T)` (global, 1 arg) and `DispatchEvent<T>(uint netId, in T)` (per-entity, 2 args).
They are **different methods** — a global hook never sees per-netId dispatches and vice-versa. Check
the dispatch site in the dump: `EventCenter.DispatchEvent(in @event)` → `RegisterGameEventHook`;
`EventCenter.DispatchEvent(someNetId, in @event)` → `RegisterGameEventHookByNetId`. The per-netId
native body is `void(uint netId, IntPtr eventPtr)` (validated as the 2-param inflation).

### How it works (mechanism)

1. Resolve `XDTGame.Core.EventCenter` via `FindAuraMonoClassByFullName`.
2. `FindAuraMonoMethodOnHierarchy(cls, "DispatchEvent", 1)` — paramcount **1** selects the global
   `DispatchEvent<T>(in T)` (the per-netId overload `DispatchEvent<T>(uint, in T)` has 2).
3. Inflate that open generic method per concrete event class (`mono_metadata_get_generic_inst` +
   `mono_class_inflate_generic_method`), validate `AuraMonoMethodParamCountIs(inflated, 1)`.
4. Resolve own `IntPtr mono_compile_method(IntPtr)` export (the engine's shared
   `auraMonoCompileMethod` is declared `void`, losing the code ptr); compile → native code pointer.
5. `MonoMod.RuntimeDetour.NativeDetour(nativePtr, body)` + `GenerateTrampoline` — the modern
   Iced-relocating hook (same proven path as fishing `NotifyFloatInWater`), **not** the abandoned
   14-byte `BubbleMonoNativeHook` steal (see §5).

**Key ABI fact (was the open risk, now confirmed safe):** for a value-type (non-shared) generic
instantiation mono emits dedicated code with **no hidden rgctx arg**, so `DispatchEvent<T>(in T)`'s
native signature is exactly `void(IntPtr eventPtr)` — `in T` is a raw pointer to the **bare** struct
(no mono object header; by-ref, not boxed). Read payload fields by offset off `eventPtr`. Verified
in-world: instrument open/close logged real payloads (`type=12`=Wbass, netId, staticId) with no crash.

### Detour-body rules (native boundary)

The 16 fixed static slot bodies (`EventSlotBody0..15`, no closures) must **not** throw, allocate, or
call into Mono/Il2Cpp/Unity. Each only `Marshal.Copy`s `payloadBytes` into a preallocated ring
buffer and forwards via the slot's trampoline. The main-thread drain (`DrainGameEventHooks`) decodes
the snapshot and invokes handlers, where any work is allowed. Producer (body) and consumer (drain)
both run on the Unity main thread, so the ring is single-threaded in practice.

### Scope limit — do NOT mass-hook all ~1450 events

Each event type needs its own inflated `DispatchEvent<T>` + detour. Hooking hundreds at once is a
process-crash risk: per-type gsharedvt ABI roulette (some `T` may compile to shared code with a
hidden arg → signature mismatch → AV), mass JIT of every instantiation, and high-frequency bodies on
per-frame events. The engine caps at `MaxEventHookSlots` (128) concurrent hooks for this reason. Hook
the specific events a feature needs; use `MasterLogGameEvents` to discover/verify payloads first.

### Verified reusable events & payload layouts

Offsets below are by-offset reads for the engine (scalars only; ref fields noted). Verify live with
`MasterLogGameEvents` after a game patch — mono value-type layout is assumed natural/sequential.

#### "Object appeared / disappeared on the map" — the common channel

`EntityCreateEvent` / `EntityRemoveEvent` (namespace `XDTLevelAndEntity.BaseSystem.EntitiesManager`)
fire for **every** ECS entity as it streams/spawns in or out. Dispatched via
`EventCenter.DispatchEvent(in @event)` from
[`EntityManager`](../ilspy-dumps/XDTLevelAndEntity/ScriptsRefactory.LevelAndEntity.BaseSystem/EntityManager.cs)
(lines ~468 / ~492), so the engine hooks them. This is the generic "object on map" channel for
radar / aura-farm targets / cookers / gift boxes / insects / pets — subscribe once, read `netId`,
then qualify the entity by component/archetype in the handler (main thread).

Both carry `public EntityData Value` — a **readonly struct** (`ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.ComponentsData.EntityData`),
inlined into the event, so its fields are readable by offset. `payloadBytes = 32`:

| field | type | offset |
|---|---|---|
| `level` | `EGameLevel` (sbyte) | 0 |
| `entityId` | uint | 4 |
| **`netId`** | **uint** | **8** ← key |
| `field` | uint | 12 |
| `tag` | `EntityTag` (ulong) | 16 |
| `archetypeId` | short bucket@24 / short index@26 | 24 |
| `_priority` | int | 28 |

Note: high-frequency in dense towns — only process while a feature needs it and keep the per-event
qualify check light. There is **no** dedicated `DataCreated<CookBuildComponent>` ("cooker appeared")
event; cookers are detected by filtering `EntityCreateEvent` netIds for `CookBuildComponent`.

**Measured frequency & filtering (in-world 2026-06-30, `MasterLogEntityEvents`).** Very high and
bursty: ~**1650/s** during a scene/world-epoch load, **hundreds/s** in bursts during play.
Critically, **most creates have `netId == 0`** — local/non-networked view entities (one archetype,
`1:53`, dominates the spam). Real networked objects (cookers, players, pets, props) have `netId != 0`.
So the first filter is a cheap `if (netId == 0) return;` in the handler, which drops the bulk. Even
the `netId != 0` subset still bursts to **~210/s** (and ~870/s on load), so a per-create AuraMono
component check is **not** viable blanket — it needs an archetype prefilter (`archetypeId`@24: read
the cooker archetype off a known stove once, then component-check only matching `bucket:index`).
**Verdict:** `EntityCreateEvent` is a valid *generic* "object on map" channel but heavy; prefer a
targeted event when one exists.

**For cookers specifically, do NOT use `EntityCreateEvent`.** `CookingComponent.OnSpawned` calls
`_OnComponentDataUpdated()` → dispatches `UpdateCookingStatusEvent` ([CookingComponent.cs:362](../ilspy-dumps/XDTLevelAndEntity/XDTLevelAndEntity.Gameplay.Component.Homeland/CookingComponent.cs)),
so a stove is already seen at stream-in (and on `OnUnSpawn`) through the cooking-status hook NetCook
already installs. **Implemented & confirmed in-world (2026-06-30):** `OnUpdateCookingStatusEvent` →
`TryRegisterNetCookWorldCookerFromCookingEvent` derives the owner (`ExtractNetCookOwnerNetId(levelObjectNetId)`
= low 32 bits), resolves staticId/cookerType via the same AuraMono path Capture uses, and registers it
(once) into `netCookRegisteredWorldCookers` — no `EntityCreateEvent`, no archetype guessing, no
per-create check. Log confirmed: `Event-registered world cooker owner=… static=370001 type=0`
accumulating. It only **populates** the registry; Capture still gates which stoves are used and culls
far ones via `RemoveOutOfRangeNetCookTargets` (so no distance check in the handler). This replaces the
dead `CookBuildComponent.OnSpawned/OnComponentUpdated` Harmony hooks (their managed type is absent on
this AuraMono-only build).

The hook is registered **unconditionally from `OnUpdate`** (not gated on NetCook being active) so the
engine installs the detour at world-entry — early enough to catch most stove `OnSpawned`. **Timing
caveat (why "install earlier" can't fully solve it):** the detour cannot exist before its event type
is loaded, and `UpdateCookingStatusEvent` / `EventCenter` / `CookingComponent` load *lazily on town
entry* — i.e. at essentially the same moment the stoves stream in and dispatch `OnSpawned`. So stoves
already loaded in the first frames of the very first town are missed by the event and are only found by
the Capture `GetComponents<CookBuildComponent>` scan; a one-time scan-seed after a world-epoch change
would close that gap (not implemented). `cookerType` often resolves to 0 at registration but is
re-resolved from `staticId` at capture (`TryAddSynthesizedNetCookBurnerTargets`), so it's harmless.

#### Other verified payloads

| Event | Namespace | `payloadBytes` | Fields (offset) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `InstrumentPanelOpenEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 24 | `InstrumentType`(int)@0, `instrumentNetId`(uint)@4, `instrumentLevelObjectNetId`(ulong)@8, `staticId`(int)@16 | hooked by InstrumentHotkeyGuard |
| `InstrumentPanelCloseEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 0 | *(empty)* | dispatch-only signal |
| `CollectObjectShowEvent` | `ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events` | 8 | `netId`(uint)@0, `show`(bool)@4 | **fully scalar** — collectable show/hide |
| `RefreshBackPackEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 4 | `storageType`(EStorageType=int)@0 | bag changed (any mutation); `EStorageType.Backpack=1`. Used by **AutoSell** as a "bag dirty" signal — the periodic scan/sell is skipped when no backpack event arrived since the last scan (hook registered on enable; falls back to always-scan until installed) |
| `RefreshBackPackGridEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 16 | `storageType`(int)@0, `isRemove`(bool)@4, `isAdd`(bool)@5, `gridId`(long)@8 | precise per-slot add/remove (`StorageBase.AddItem` sets `isAdd=true`, `gridId=0`); `DataCreated<BackpackItem>` (nested generic) carries the full added item |
| `PlayerStaminaUpdatedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 12 | `CurrentValue`(int)@0, `BaseMaxValue`(int)@4, `BoostedMaxValue`(int)@8 | self energy change (PropertySyncSystem; the game's EnergyModule renders the panel off it). Hooked by **Auto Eat**: feeds the energy cache + requests an immediate trigger check — replaces the UI-text parse of the energy panel (parse stays as pre-first-event fallback) |
| `HandHoldUpdatedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events.Player` | 0 | *(empty)* | dispatched by ToolSystem on every `ToolComponent` update (**durability**), skin change and handhold change. Hooked by **Auto Repair** as a tool-data dirty flag: triggers one AuraMono durability read instead of the 0.5-1s timed poll (poll stretches to a 45s safety net once the event is proven; toast scan skipped while channel healthy) |
| `ToolRestorerEvent` | `ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events` | 8 | `itemNetId`(uint)@0, `staticId`(int)@4 | repair-kit throw approved by server (`CanPutRestorerResult`; fires for auto AND manual use). Opens the **repair-aura window** (see AutoEatRepair `EnsureRepairAuraEventHooks`) |
| `ToolRestoreDestroyEvent` | `ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events` | 4 | `ownerNetId`(uint)@0 | **misleading name**: dispatched from `ToolRestorerComponent.OnSpawned` when a restorer entity LANDS (tells the old one / throw action to clean up). Filter `ownerNetId == self`; refreshes the repair-aura window |
| `UpdateBuffUiEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 4 | `buffId`(int)@0 | self buff add/UPDATE/remove — identical payload for all three, so no toggle-tracking; the game's SkillWidget (and our repair state) re-query `ToolSystem.HasToolRestoreBuff()` on it instead. Tool-restore buff ids are hardcoded **701-706** in that method |

#### Fishing events (all global)

All dispatched globally from `FishingProtocolManager` / `HandHoldFishingRod` (`EventCenter.DispatchEvent(in @event)`). Consumer: [`AutoFishingFarm`](../buddy/AutoFishingFarm.cs) — uses the bite/buoy events to open a low-latency Instant-Catch activation window and the bite/result events for exact per-cast diagnostics. The **continuous** battle/reel control (pull strength, pressed) stays per-frame polled — events only mark transitions.

| Event | `payloadBytes` | Fields (offset) | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CmdCastRodResult` | 4 | `result`(bool)@0 | cast confirmed |
| `CmdActivateRodBuoyResult` | 4 | `result`(bool)@0 | float/buoy active (in water) |
| `CmdSetOnBaitFishShadowId` | 8 | `fishShadowNetId`(uint)@0, `needShowOff`(bool)@4 | fish targeting bait |
| `CmdOnFishBait` | 4 | `fishShadowNetId`(uint)@0 | **bite** (fish on bait) |
| `InformBattleStart` | 0 | *(empty)* | battle started |
| `CmdFishBattleResult` | 12 | `result`(bool)@0, `fishId`(int)@4, `failReason`(enum)@8 | **catch result** |
| `PlayerCatchFish` | 8 | `playerNetId`(uint)@0, `fishNetId`(uint)@4 | fish caught |
| `ResetFishState` | 0 | *(empty)* | cycle reset (recast point) |
| `FishingStickInputUpdated` | 8 | `input`(Vector2)@0 | reel stick input (**continuous** — stays per-frame) |
| `BottomDialogEvent` | `ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events` | 12 | `message`(string ref)@0 **unreadable**, `active`(bool)@8 | read `active` only; `clickCallback`(Action ref) is the real confirm action but ref-unreadable |
| `UIPanelOpenEvent` / `UIPanelClosingEvent` / `UIPanelCloseEvent` | `XDTGame.Framework.UI` | — | `panelType`(System.Type ref)@0 **unreadable** | universal panel open/close (`UIView.Open` dispatches Open after `OnStart`; `Close` dispatches Closing before `OnStop`). Usable today as a "some panel changed" trigger followed by one `UIManager.GetView(Type)` probe — [`AvatarStudioFeature`](../buddy/AvatarStudioFeature.cs) does exactly that |

#### Pet-play QTE events (cat = global, dog = per-netId)

Cat events dispatch **globally** (hook with `RegisterGameEventHook`); dog events dispatch **per-netId**
(hook with `RegisterGameEventHookByNetId`). Wired in [`PetPlayFeature`](../buddy/PetPlayFeature.cs).

| Event | Dispatch | `payloadBytes` | Fields (offset) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CatPlayQuestionForUiEvent` | global ([MeowProtocolManager.ShowTeaseQte](../ilspy-dumps/XDTDataAndProtocol/XDTDataAndProtocol.ProtocolService.Meow/MeowProtocolManager.cs)) | 12 | `catHandle`(uint)@0, `questionId`(MeowQteType=byte)@4, `duration`(float)@8 | **the cat answer** — `MeowQteType {Up=0,Down=1,Shake=2}` maps 1:1 to answer enum `MeowTeaseQteType`, so `qteValue == (int)questionId`; answered directly, no sprite scan |
| `CatPlayAnswerForUiEvent` | global | 16 | `catHandle`(uint)@0, `answerId`(KittyTeaseQteResultType=byte)@4, `score`(int)@8, `isSelfCat`(bool)@12 | result of the answer |
| `TeaseQteEvent` | global | 4 | `catHandle`(uint)@0 | cat QTE input made |
| `TeaseDogRoundBeginEvent` | **per-netId** ([PetProtocolManager](../ilspy-dumps/XDTDataAndProtocol/XDTDataAndProtocol.ProtocolService.Pet/PetProtocolManager.cs)) | 0 | *(empty; netId = the dog)* | kicks the dog resolver (choice needs live learning/motion state) |
| `PetTeaseQteResultEvent` | **per-netId** | 8 | `result`(PetTeaseQteResult=int)@0, `isSelfPet`(bool)@4 | dog QTE result |
| `TeaseDogPlayEvent` | **per-netId** | 0 | *(empty)* | dog play session signal |

#### Cooking events (all global)

All dispatch via `EventCenter.DispatchEvent(in @event)` (global). Consumer: [`HeartopiaComplete.NetCook.cs`](../buddy/HeartopiaComplete.NetCook.cs) caches `UpdateCookingStatusEvent` per `cookNetId` to drive the cook state machine without the per-stove AuraMono status poll (cache-first in `TryGetNetCookTargetCookingStatus`, AuraMono fallback until the first event / if the hook never installs).

| Event | Namespace | `payloadBytes` | Fields (offset) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`UpdateCookingStatusEvent`** | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 64 | `levelObjectNetId`(ulong)@0, `cookNetId`(uint)@8, `textId`(int)@12, **`data`** = `CookingComponentData` (struct, inline) @16 | the prize — fires on every cooker status change; `data` carries the full status |
| `StartCookEvent` | `ScriptsRefactory…Events` | 24 | `cookerNetId`(uint)@0, `levelObjectNetId`(ulong)@8, `cookWithoutRice`(bool)@16, `foodItemId`(int)@20 | cooking started (prepare succeeded) |
| `CookResultEvent` | `ScriptsRefactory…Events` | 24 | `cookerNetId`(uint)@0, `levelObjectNetId`(ulong)@8, `interaction`(CookingInteraction enum)@16 | cook interaction result |
| `UpdateCookingRecentEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | — | `recentRecipes`(**List\<int\> ref**) | ❌ ref field — unreadable by offset |

`CookingComponentData` (inlined in `UpdateCookingStatusEvent.data` at +16, 48 bytes) — scalar fields read by offset off the event base:

| `data` field | type | event offset |
|---|---|---|
| `Status` | `CookingStatus`(int) | **24** ← `Idle=0,Preparing=1,Cooking=2,Danger=3,Relief=4,Succeed=5,Failed=6` |
| `FoodQuality` | int | 44 |
| `BaseProgress` | float | 52 |
| `FoodItemId` | int | 56 (cooked food id) |
| `OwnerNetId` | uint | 60 |

`UpdateCookingStatusEvent` is exactly 64 bytes = `EventPayloadCap` — if a patch adds fields to `CookingComponentData` the tail truncates; bump `EventPayloadCap`. The NetCook handler guards `Status ∈ [0,6]` and skips caching otherwise (catches a layout/offset drift without crashing).

#### Party events (all global)

Consumer: [`PartyAutoDeclineFeature`](../buddy/PartyAutoDeclineFeature.cs) — the two invite events
are registered **suppressed** (the invite never reaches `PartyModule`, so no phone call is built),
the other two drive auto-leave.

| Event | Namespace | `payloadBytes` | Fields (offset) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PartyInvitedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 8 | `partyNetId`(uint)@0, `inviterNetId`(uint)@4 | fully scalar; suppressing it kills the invite phone call |
| `OtherRoomPartyInvitedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 0 | `InviteInfo` = `OtherTownPartyInviteInfo` — **ref-heavy** (strings, `Guid`, `List<int>`, `Dictionary`), nothing readable by offset | cross-town invite; registered at 0 bytes purely to own a suppression slot |
| `PartyMembershipChangedEvent` | `XDTGameSystem.UI` | 1 | `inParty`(bool)@0 | dispatched by `PartyModule.RefreshPartyPanelVisibility` on every `SelfPartyChangedEvent` — the clean "am I in a party" edge. Prefer it over `SelfPartyChangedEvent`, whose `PartyInfo?` / `StopPartyReasonType?` fields are nullable structs and unreadable by offset |
| `ApplyPartyGameResultEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 8 | `errorCode`(`PartyErrorCode`=int)@0, `partyNetId`(uint)@4 | **intent discriminator**: only ever dispatched in response to the server's `ApplyPartyTipsEvent`, which the server only sends because the client sent `ApplyPartyGameNetworkCommand`. A server-side area auto-join arrives as `JoinPartyTipsEvent` and never lands here. Dispatched immediately *before* `UpdateSelfPartyInfo()`, so it always precedes the `PartyMembershipChangedEvent` it belongs to (same frame, ring drains in dispatch order) |

#### Activity-event events (all global)

⚠️ **`Party` and `ActivityEvent` are different subsystems.** Table `Party` has **5** rows (Free /
Sea Fishing / Tea / Obstacle / Hide-and-Seek party); table `ActivityEvent` has **~606** — every
scheduled world event lives there, including all the 鱼潮 shoal events (Neritic Shoal Event =
ids 225/226, groupId 45). Hooking the party events does nothing for a shoal event and vice versa.
Check which table a feature's target belongs to *before* choosing events — see
[`search-gamedata`](../.claude/skills/search-gamedata/SKILL.md).

Consumer: [`ActivityEventAutoDeclineFeature`](../buddy/ActivityEventAutoDeclineFeature.cs).

| Event | Namespace | `payloadBytes` | Fields (offset) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ActivityInvitedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 8 | `activityNetId`(uint)@0, `inviterNetId`(uint)@4 | fully scalar; suppressing it kills the invite phone call (`EventCallData`) |
| `OtherRoomActivityInvitedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 0 | `InviteInfo` = `OtherTownActivityInviteInfo` — ref-heavy | cross-town invite; 0 bytes, suppression slot only |
| `SelfActivityChangedEvent` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 0 | `endEventInfo` = `ActivityEventInfo?` — **nullable struct, unreadable by offset** | membership edge; dispatched by `UpdateActivityEvent` (netId == current) and `UpdateParticipantInfo` (self in participants), so it covers the server-side area add. Resolve the actual state with `ActivityEventSystem.IsSelfInActivity()` (0-arg bool) — **not** `IsSelfInActivityOrParty()` |
| `OnRequestJoinActivitySuccess` | `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 4 | `activityNetId`(uint)@0 | **intent discriminator**: dispatched only by `RequestJoinActivityResult` on success, which only runs because the client sent `ApplyForActivityEventCommand`. A server-side area add never reaches it |

Commands (`ActivityEventProtocolManager`, all static): `SendQuitActivityEventCommand()` (0 args) —
leave; `SendRejectActivityEventCommand(uint eventNetId, long inviterShortId, ActivityOpType)` with
`Accept=1, Later=2, Reject=3, Overtime=4` — a **real** reject protocol, unlike parties. Note the
`inviterShortId`: `ActivityInvitedEvent` carries net ids only, and converting needs
`PlayerProtocolManager.TryGetPlayerShortId(uint, out long)` — a value-type out-param through
`mono_runtime_invoke`, i.e. the stack-corruption trap. The mod therefore suppresses instead of
rejecting, which the server sees as an unanswered call.

#### Per-component events (`DataCreated<T>` / `DataRemoved<T>`)

`ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events.DataCreated<T>` (`struct DataCreated<T> { T Value; }`) is
dispatched **per component type** by the various `ClientSystem.*SyncSystem`s
(`DataCreated<BlockComponent>`, `DataCreated<PetEntityData>`, …) via
`EventCenter.DispatchEvent<DataCreated<TComp>>`. More precise than `EntityCreateEvent`, **but** it is
a nested generic — to hook it you must build the `DataCreated<TComp>` instantiation via
`mono_class_bind_generic_parameters` (`auraMonoClassBindGenericParameters`) rather than resolving by
name. Deferred until a feature needs the precision.

## 4. Event catalogue (by namespace)

~1450 event structs total. The big buckets:

| Namespace | Count | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events` | 810 | server/protocol-driven gameplay events (the bulk) |
| `XDTGameSystem.UI` | 316 | UI mode/panel focus + system UI events |
| `ScriptsRefactory.DataAndProtocol.Events` | 170 | older protocol-layer events (birds, pets, animation, …) |
| `XDTGame.UI` | 31 | UI bridge events (game-mode focus, blueprint, etc.) |
| `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events.GameSetting` | 15 | settings-changed notifications |
| `XDTDataAndProtocol.Events.Player` | 14 | player-state events |
| *(others)* | ~96 | build/competition, party, energy, homeland, navigation, … |

Full enumerated list grouped by namespace: **[GAME_EVENTS_LIST.md](GAME_EVENTS_LIST.md)**.

## 5. InstrumentHotkeyGuard — history & final design

**Original bug (historical).** Mod hotkeys still fired while playing (`SetHandhold toolId=1/3/5` =
Axe/Rod/Net equips) because the guard only blocked keys in the instrument's **note layout**, and
(a) `pianoSemitone` couldn't be read via managed reflection on the absent `GameSettingSystem` so the
KeyMode22 piano layout was wrong, and (b) any hotkey bound *outside* the layout (the equip keys) was
never in the blocking set. Fixed by **blocking all mod hotkeys except the menu toggle while an
instrument is open**, and by driving "is open" from events instead of a per-frame poll — see the
event-driven implementation below.

### Implemented (final) — event-driven

`InstrumentHotkeyGuardFeature` now drives the "instrument open" state from the event engine (§3):
it `RegisterGameEventHook`s `InstrumentPanelOpenEvent` (→ flag true, captures `InstrumentType`) and
`InstrumentPanelCloseEvent` (→ flag false). `IsInstrumentPanelOpen()` reads the flag once the detour
is installed (zero per-frame cost, no native-AV exposure); while a hook hasn't installed yet it falls
back to the legacy throttled `GetView` poll. While the panel is open it **blocks every mod hotkey
except the menu toggle** — this also fixes the original bug where hotkeys bound outside the note
layout (e.g. the Axe/Rod/Net equip keys) still fired while playing. The per-key layout matching and
`pianoSemitone` (`PlayerPrefs.GetInt("PianoSemitone", 0)`) logic now only feed the fallback path.

### Native detour — the working mechanism vs the abandoned one

- ✅ **NativeDetour on inflated `DispatchEvent<T>`** (the engine in §3) — installed once per event,
  forwards via a trampoline, no per-frame cost. Proven, no crash.
- ❌ **`BubbleMonoNativeHook` on `InstrumentPanel.OnStart`/`OnStop`** — earlier attempt; **crashed**
  on first open. Root cause: that hook steals a **fixed 14 bytes** of prologue and cannot relocate
  RIP-relative instructions (`CreateBubble`'s prologue happened to be relocatable, `OnStart`/`OnStop`'s
  was not). The engine avoids this by using MonoMod's Iced-relocating `NativeDetour`. (Also note
  `mono_method_get_unmanaged_thunk` is a native-call wrapper that normal managed/vtable calls never
  traverse — intercept the `mono_compile_method` code pointer instead, which the engine does.)

### Other event routes (not pursued)

- **EventCenter `AddListener<T>` subscription via AuraMono** (true listener registration): would need
  to construct a managed `Action<EventStruct>` delegate around a native callback and pass it to the
  non-generic `AddListener(Type, Delegate)` overload — and dispatch does `node.data as Action<T>`, so
  any delegate that isn't exactly `Action<EventStruct>` is silently skipped. Strictly more moving
  parts than the dispatcher detour for the same outcome. Not pursued.
- **mono vtable slot swap**: safer than byte-patching but needs vtable internals not currently
  exported.
