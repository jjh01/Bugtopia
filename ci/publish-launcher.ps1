.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes both launcher flavours and collects them into one folder.

.DESCRIPTION
    The launcher ships as a single exe with everything inside it, and it ships twice:

      offline  carries the mod and the bootstrap; downloads nothing, ever
      online   carries no mod at all and fetches the newest release from GitHub

    They are different assemblies, not one assembly with a switch, so both are published and both
    are kept. The output is two files and nothing else - no runtime beside them, no folder to
    unpack, which is the whole point of the NativeAOT build.

    NativeAOT needs the MSVC linker, and ILCompiler's own toolchain probe cannot always find it.
    This script initialises vcvars64.bat and hands ILCompiler the environment instead, which is the
    difference between a publish that works and one that fails looking for vswhere.

.PARAMETER OutputDirectory
    Where the finished exes go. Defaults to release\ beside the repository.

.PARAMETER PluginDll
    The mod to embed in the offline build. Defaults to the local BepInEx build; CI points it at the
    same bugtopia-bepinex.dll the release ships, so the launcher carries the published file rather
    than a second copy built beside it.

.PARAMETER VersionLabel
    Names the output files with this instead of the version resource inside them. CI passes the tag,
    which drops the commit hash a release asset has no use for.

.PARAMETER SkipPayloadCheck
    Publish even when a payload file is missing. The build only warns about those, which is right
    for day-to-day work and wrong for a release, so this script refuses by default.
