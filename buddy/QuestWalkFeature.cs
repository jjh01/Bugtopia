    // QUEST WALK — walk to the point the GAME published for the tracked quest, across worlds.
    //
    // The game already builds both halves, so this feature does no pathfinding of its own:
    //   * the POINT — TrackingSystem._trackingItems, where TrackData.TaskTableId IS the quest's
    //     taskId (0 = not a quest);
    //   * the ROUTE — TrackingPathModule._path, a ~51-point polyline whose first point is the
    //     player. It is reused when the game happens to be routing at the item we picked.
    //
    // Everything below was measured in a live game before it was written here (the throwaway probe
    // in the plan doc). Each rule is one failure that actually happened, so none of them are
    // defensive guesses:
    //
    //  1. FOLLOW THE QUEST ITEM, NOT THE DRAWN ONE. The game tracks several things and draws
    //     exactly one. Underwater a LOCAL furniture marker 0.4 m away won the star line while the
    //     quest track sat 29 m off — "follow what is drawn" walked half a metre and declared
    //     arrival. Pick by TrackReason.Task.
    //  2. ENTER AN INJECTED ROUTE AT THE NEAREST POINT. _path refreshes on the game's own cadence,
    //     so by re-injection time its leading points are already behind the player. Feeding it from
    //     index 0 walked BACKWARDS: a walk that began 85 m out was 114 m out a minute later.
    //  3. A PORTAL'S TRIGGER NEEDS 0.5 m. At 1 m the walk parks on the doorstep and the transfer
    //     never fires — silently, which reads exactly like the feature being broken.
    //  4. A WORLD CHANGE IS A PAUSE, NOT AN ENDING. Every cached position belongs to the old map,
    //     and the game republishes its track a beat after the gate opens.
    //  5. ARRIVAL IS FLAT ON LAND AND 3-D UNDERWATER. Flat called 0.91 m "arrived" while the player
    //     stood on a roof 4.74 m above the NPC.
    //  6. ANY CACHED "IS X PRESENT" EXPIRES WITH THE WORLD. An answer learned underwater survived
    //     the trip back to land and silently reverted the portal radius to 1 m.
