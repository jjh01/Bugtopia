    // Aura Farm "walk to the node" mode — move along the ground instead of teleporting, following
    // the route the game's own Track star-line follows.
    //
    // ROUTE SOURCE: the managed snapshot of the game's waypoint graph plus a C# A* over it
    // (TrackPathGraphFeature.cs). NOT a Unity navmesh — the game never loads one, proven in-game.
    //
    // MOVEMENT: TrySetGameMoveAxis (MovementInputFeature.cs) feeds the analog joystick axis through
    // the game's own locomotion chain, so ground-following, collision, slopes and swimming all come
    // for free and the server sees ordinary movement. NEVER a position write — a teleport-driven
    // "walk" is exactly what MovementAntiCheating samples for.
    //
    // THREE DECIDED CONFLICTS (do not re-litigate — see the walk-to-node plan in project memory):
    //   1. Mutually exclusive with Stealth Foraging. That mode parks the player under the terrain
    //      on noclip; walking needs ordinary ground collision. Enabling one clears the other.
    //   2. Forces game speed to 1x for the whole run. ToggleAutoFarm normally sets timeScale 5,
    //      and the server measures REAL time — at 5x a legitimate 4 m/s walk is a 20 m/s cheat.
    //   3. No walk/teleport distance cap: every NODE hop walks, at any distance. Long-hop
    //      teleports are a deferred follow-up. AREA hops (`area:*`) still teleport — those are
    //      cross-map world-load checkpoints, not resource approaches.
    //
    // The teleport path survives only as a SAFETY NET: no route, or stuck-detection escalation.
