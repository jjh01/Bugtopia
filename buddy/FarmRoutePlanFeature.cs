    // The node-tour planner.
    //
    // WHY. The farm used to take the NEAREST node on every scan. For teleporting that did not
    // matter — a hop costs the same from anywhere. For walking, a greedy pick falls apart: the
    // nearest node leads into a dead end, the way back is recomputed, and the route jitters. On top
    // of that the candidate list was rebuilt from scratch every 2 seconds, so the target could
    // change in the middle of a walk.
    //
    // WHAT WE DO. Build the sequence once, then only:
    //   * walk to the HEAD of the list,
    //   * drop the head once it is collected,
    //   * INSERT new points without rebuilding anything.
    //
    // ALGORITHM. This is an open travelling salesman (a route with no return to the start). The
    // classic pair for problems this size:
    //   1. Nearest neighbour — a quick initial sequence (about 25% worse than optimal on average);
    //   2. 2-opt — reverse a segment when that shortens the route (brings it to roughly 5%).
    // Both are O(n²) per pass; at n ≤ FarmTourMaxStops that is tens of microseconds.
    //
    // New points are added by CHEAPEST INSERTION: find the position i that minimises
    //     d(t[i-1], p) + d(p, t[i]) − d(t[i-1], t[i])
    // — that is, where the point can be squeezed in so the route grows least. The existing order is
    // left alone, which means the current walk's target cannot move out from under it.
    //
    // ⚠️ THE TOUR HEAD IS NOT TOUCHED while a walk is running. 2-opt works on the tail only
    // (indices ≥ 1); otherwise the optimiser reorders the current target and the walker turns
    // around — exactly the illness behind "the route kept rebuilding back and forth".
    //
    // ⚠️ Distances are horizontal. Walking does not change height, and counting Y made points that
    // are neighbours on the ground read as "far" purely because one of them sits on a rock.
