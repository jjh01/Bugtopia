    // OCEAN CLEANUP BOSS — fight the event's public pollutant the way a player does.
    //
    // Model measured live over four fights on 2026-09-15 (tools/CleanupProbe recordings):
    //   * the boss (TypeId 140012, MonsterType PublicPollutant) spawns at a FIXED spot
    //     (-17.3, -73.1, 40.0) once the personal stage ends; its HP is scaled per event (36k..72k);
    //   * cleaning reaches 9.5 m from its centre — SeaCleanChecker.DetectMaxDistance (5 m) plus the
    //     boss detection sphere (4.5 m). The checker acquires by a 50° cone from the player's
    //     forward; once holding, only IsMainButtonDown + target alive are re-checked;
    //   * three explosions per fight at ~62/46/26 % HP. ExplosionStarted carries an 8 s countdown
    //     and a 4.5 m safe zone drawn from ≥3 fixed spots 8-16 m away (the same spot can repeat);
    //     ExplosionFinished bounces every player OUTSIDE the zone away (PlayerBounceContext);
    //   * the boss QTE is a HOLD-AND-RELEASE loop (SeaCleanMonsterComponent.StartQTE/TickQTE/
    //     BeginHold/EndHold): Ready → the button goes down → Holding → after the round's hold
    //     duration → AwaitingRelease (the gauge turns red) → the button must go UP → the round
    //     counts, Ready again with a new duration → … → Completed after 1-3 rounds. A button that
    //     stays down through AwaitingRelease just waits for the QTE to time out (Failed), and the
    //     boss takes no damage meanwhile (StartQTE sends ReqStopCleanPublicPollutant). So the
    //     SeaCleanExecutionStateEvent drives the button: release on AwaitingRelease, press again on
    //     Ready / Completed / Failed;
    //   * moving while cleaning stops the clean (PlayerStateSeaClean.OnStateTick), and re-entering
    //     the clean needs a fresh PRESS (SeaCleanCommand fires on the press, not on the level), so
    //     the walker is released and the character settled before the button goes down, and the
    //     hold is re-pressed whenever IsCleaning reads false.
    //
    // Levers, all through AuraMono: the farm walker for the approach and the dash to the bubble
    // (TryBeginFarmWalk / RunFarmWalkTick / AbortFarmWalk — the Quest Walk driving pattern),
    // PlayerMoveComponent.WorldFaceTo for the facing (the Fishing.cs helper with its position
    // write off), LocalPlayerComponent._OnMainButtonEvent(bool) for the hold — the game's own
    // input listener, so SeaCleanCommand → PlayerStateSeaClean runs with the animation, the beam
    // and the ReqStartCleanPublicPollutant protocol exactly as for a real press — and
    // PlayerStateSeaClean.IsCleaning to verify the hold actually locked a target.
    //
    // Coexistence: while the event is joined, Aura Farm's node picker targets only contamination
    // inside the measured event area (CleanupEventFarmGateActive), so the personal stage is farmed
    // by Aura Farm and the boss by this file. The walker has one writer: Aura Farm is stopped when
    // the fight starts and restarted after it when this file was the one that stopped it; a Quest
    // Walk is stopped the same way.
