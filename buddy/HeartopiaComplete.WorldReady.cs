    // Central "the world is up" gate.
    //
    // PRIMARY source is the game's own level state machine, polled via GameWorld (see
    // HeartopiaComplete.GameWorldProbe.cs). The loading-screen EVENTS below are kept only as a
    // fallback for the window before GameWorld resolves (~T+55..60s on a cold start) and for builds
    // where it cannot be resolved at all. Phase 3 removes them entirely — they are the one hook
    // that must install pre-world, and installing them is what aborts the process
    // (see project memory: eventhook-preworld-inflate-abort).
    //
    // Why the FSM beats the events, both measured live:
    //   * The events cannot tell the LOGIN level from a real world — both emit LoadingOpened/Closed
    //     — so the gate used to report IsWorldReady=Y while sitting on the login screen.
    //     GameWorld reports levelType 0 there (1 = town, 3 = micro-home).
    //   * Homeland enter/exit emits NO loading events at all. The gate stayed "ready" through the
    //     whole tear-down + 53s rebuild and never bumped the epoch, so per-world caches keyed on it
    //     were never invalidated. The FSM shows the full Loaded->UnLoading->Loading->Loaded arc.
    //
    // XDTGameSystem.UI.LoadingOpenedEvent / LoadingClosedEvent are empty structs (Size = 1, so 0
    // payload bytes) dispatched globally around every world load — login, town/homeland change,
    // scene transfer. LoadingClosedEvent is the earliest RELIABLE "there is a live world" signal:
    // the game's Mono images are loaded, its services are constructed and the local player exists.
    //
    // Before this gate every feature polled on its own timer (VehicleBypass 3 s, WarehouseBypass /
    // StrangerChat 5 s, GameLod 30 s, ...) starting from the very first OnUpdate — i.e. on the
    // login screen, where nothing resolves and raw static-field reads AV uncatchably (see
    // memory: AuraMono static-field login crash). Features register here instead and are called
    // back ONCE per world load, on the Unity main thread, with a bounded retry for the resolves
    // that still need a moment after the splash disappears.
    //
    // Fallback: if the loading hooks never install (slot pool exhausted, event type renamed by a
    // game update), the gate falls back to "game Mono side live + a local player has existed for
    // a few seconds". Nothing ever hangs waiting for an event that will not arrive.
