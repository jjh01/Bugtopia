    // WHY. Areas sit 200-400 m apart (356 and 390 m in the logs). On foot that is over a minute per
    // move; the server meanwhile allows 9 m/s in a vehicle against 4.3 m/s on foot
    // (MovementAntiCheating), so riding is not only faster but safer as far as anti-cheat goes.
    //
    // ⚠️ VEHICLES DO NOT SUMMON UNDERWATER. Confirmed twice by live tests: the server refuses
    // silently (VehicleErrorCode.AreaForbid sends neither an event nor a type). Sea hauls go on
    // foot, and that is not a fault — the check sits before the summon so no timeout is spent.
    //
    // ⚠️ SUMMONING NEEDS ROOM. VehicleUtility.CreateVehiclePosition runs an OverlapBox directly in
    // front of the player, and a vehicle abandoned nearby blocks the next summon. Hence the recall
    // before every summon.
    //
    // ⚠️ SUCCESS IS SILENT. The server answers only on refusal, so being seated is confirmed by
    // polling GetUsingVehicle() rather than by waiting for an event.
