    // UGUI KIT — the reusable factory library for building the mod's UI on Unity's real UI system
    // (UnityEngine.UI + Canvas hierarchy) instead of legacy IMGUI. This is the UGUI analog of
    // HeartopiaComplete.UiKitPrimitives.cs: every future tab migration composes these factories
    // instead of hand-building GameObject/Component trees. Validated by HeartopiaComplete.UguiPoc.cs,
    // which is constructed ENTIRELY from these methods.
    //
    // Vocabulary mirrors the IMGUI redesign so the two systems line up during the migration:
    //   CreateUguiPrimaryButton / CreateUguiSecondaryButton / CreateUguiDangerButton
    //     <-> DrawPrimaryActionButton / DrawSecondaryActionButton / DrawDangerActionButton
    //   Header / Body / Muted / Value labels <-> uiHeader* / uiText* / uiSubTabText* / accent roles
    // Colors are read LIVE from the same ui* theme fields the IMGUI side uses (plus the same
    // GetUiTextOnAccent / GetUiControlFill helpers), so both rendering paths stay in step. Colors
    // are snapshotted at construction time — live theme reload is NOT wired (future work).
    //
    // Hard-won interop facts baked into this file (verified against gameassembly-dumps for THIS
    // game build, Unity 2020.3.13 — do not rediscover):
    //  - UnityEngine.UI survived IL2CPP stripping intact. The TMP namespace is UNprefixed (TMPro)
    //    in the BepInEx interop but PREFIXED (Il2CppTMPro) in MelonLoader's — which is why every
    //    TMP type ref lives in UguiKitTmp.cs behind the UguiTmpTypesLoadable() runtime probe.
    //  - TMP_Dropdown / TMP_InputField are STRIPPED — Dropdown caption/items must be legacy Text
    //    (Dropdown.captionText/itemText are typed Text), which is why the kit resolves a legacy
    //    Font alongside the TMP font.
    //  - Legacy UnityEngine.UI.InputField survived intact with compiled bodies (text /
    //    SetTextWithoutNotify / characterLimit setters; nested OnChangeEvent : UnityEvent<string>
    //    is a materialized instantiation whose AddListener path the game itself exercises) —
    //    RVA evidence in the CreateUguiInputField comment.
    //  - Dropdown.Show() hardcodes its popup sub-canvas to sortingOrder 30000 — window canvases
    //    must stay BELOW that. The mod's click-blocker overlay (HeartopiaComplete.CameraInput.cs)
    //    sits at 20000 — ABOVE every game canvas but BELOW every mod UGUI window canvas, so once a
    //    window is open the overlay only ever wins raycasts OUTSIDE the window's own bounds, never
    //    inside them. Any new window's sortingOrder must stay above 20000 (the blocker) and below
    //    30000 (the Dropdown ceiling) — do not reuse 32000 anywhere, that was the pre-fix value.
    //  - Only the 3-arg RectangleContainsScreenPoint(rect, point, Camera) overload exists; pass
    //    null for the camera on ScreenSpaceOverlay canvases.
    //  - Runtime scale = Canvas.scaleFactor (NOT RectTransform.localScale: legacy Text re-rasterizes
    //    crisply under scaleFactor, but would blur under localScale). No CanvasScaler exists on kit
    //    canvases, so the manual value is never overwritten.
    //  - Drag math: mouse deltas are SCREEN pixels, anchoredPosition is CANVAS units — divide by
    //    the current scaleFactor; clamp bounds divide the screen extents the same way and must
    //    re-clamp after every scale change (bounds tighten as scale grows).
    //  - Unity 2020.3 has no full generic sharing: UnityEvent<int>.AddListener (Dropdown) is not
    //    provably compiled into this binary — CreateUguiDropdown reports wiring success via an out
    //    flag so callers can poll the value as a fallback. bool/float instances provably exist.
    //  - ClassInjector.RegisterTypeInIl2Cpp remains unused/unproven in this codebase — window drag
    //    is POLLED (ProcessUguiWindowFrame) instead of IDragHandler components, matching the F9 path.
    //  - A Sliced Image is ONE CanvasRenderer mesh (9 quads, shared vertices) — the slice-seam bug
    //    class the IMGUI menu fought cannot occur, at any scale.
