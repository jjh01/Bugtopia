.SYNOPSIS
    Builds everything the launcher needs, then publishes both of its builds.

.DESCRIPTION
    The launcher ships as a single exe with its payload inside it, and the payload comes from three
    separate builds that have nothing else in common: a native C bootstrap, a net6.0 shim that runs
    inside BepInEx's own runtime, and the mod itself. This runs all of them in order and then
    publishes the two flavours.

      offline  carries the mod and the bootstrap; downloads nothing, ever
      online   carries no mod and fetches the newest release from GitHub

    With -NoLink, a third:

      offline-nolink  the offline build, carrying the BepInEx mod built without the Telegram link

    Both land in release\ as one file each, and nothing is installed into the game folder: the mod
    is built the way CI ships it, with its deploy step switched off. See docs/LAUNCHER.md.

.PARAMETER OutputDirectory
    Where the finished exes go. Defaults to release\ beside the repository.

.PARAMETER PluginDll
    The mod to embed in the offline build. Given one, the mod is not rebuilt - point this at a
    downloaded bugtopia-bepinex.dll to package a published release rather than a local build.

.PARAMETER NoLink
    Also build the BepInEx mod with -p:Telegram=false and publish the offline launcher carrying it.
    That plugin is always built from this tree, -PluginDll or not: no release asset holds it.

.PARAMETER SkipMod
    Do not build or embed the mod. The online build is unaffected; the offline one is then missing
    its plugin, so this is for working on the launcher itself, not for producing anything.
